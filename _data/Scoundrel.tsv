You recover a Prep Point when you defeat an animal or animal-like monster.
Scoundrel	Ranger	Hunter	Social, Exploration, Stealth	You can use Cunning or Agility when actively collecting information, and can disguise yourself as terrain via “Assume a Disguise”.

You can spend a Prep Point to greatly extend your range, or to sense the emotions of those in range. You have Advantage when sensing motives and know when others lie.
Scoundrel	Ranger	Prepared	Health	Gain an additional two Prep Points. When you use a Prep Point to change Kits, you can change two Kits instead of one. You can use “What You Needed” without spending Prep Points.
Scoundrel	Ranger	Slayer	Combat, Recovery	You can use “What You Needed” to produce a weapon or ammunition that target a specific enemy’s weakness, provided that you know what the weakness is.

You can spend a Prep Point to change the chosen Skill, provided you have a few minutes to concentrate. You can use “Assume a Disguise” without spending Prep Points.
Scoundrel	Spy	Infiltration Team	Social, Stealth	Nearby allies can use your Cunning when moving in stealth. You can use a Prep Point to prevent you or your allies from being revealed when they otherwise would be. “Assume a Disguise” also produces disguises for your allies.
Scoundrel	Spy	Iocane Powder	Combat, Stealth, Recovery	Your sneak attacks can put targets to sleep and wipe away their short-term memory when they would otherwise incapacitate. Successfully taking out a target in this way recovers a Prep Point.
Scoundrel	Spy	Shadowdancing	Exploration, Stealth	You can move your shadow independently of your body. Your shadow can interact with physical objects, including moving objects and attacking enemies, but takes your action to do so.
