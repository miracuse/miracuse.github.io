      <p>
        When you <b>do something challenging</b> the GM will tell you to roll and add a <a href="../docs/gameplay/skills.html" target="_blank">Skill</a> (such as Strength or Cunning). You can either use the "Roll Dice" button, or roll a ten-sided die and map the result using the table below.

      <h3>Success and Failure</h3>
      <p>
        The GM will <a href="../docs/gm_pages/setting_difficulty_levels.html" target="_blank">determine if you've succeeded</a> based on how hard the task was and how high you rolled.

      <h3>Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>
      <p>
        When the GM tells you to take Advantage, <b>you roll twice and take the better result</b>. Similarly, Disadvantage has you roll twice and take the worse result.

      <p>
        <a href="../docs/gameplay/health.html" target="_blank">Health</a> is measured in Boxes. <b>Whenever you take damage, you mark a box</b>. The GM will tell you if the box is Physical or Mental depending on the source of the damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>If you run out of Physical or Mental boxes, you become incapacitated</b>. You cannot act in the game until at least one of those boxes is cleared, either by resting or healing.
      </p>

      <h3>Healing</h3>
      <p>
        The primary way to recover boxes is <a href="../docs/adventuring/exploration/index.html#making-camp" target="_blank">Making Camp</a>. Some characters also have abilities that can recover Physical boxes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Fighting Tab -->
    <div id="fighting" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>Offense</h3>
      <p>
        <b>When you attack something, you roll a Skill</b> just like you would for any other action. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Using a sword might be Strength or Agility. Casting a spell would be Magic. Shooting with a bow or gun could be Perception. You successfully hit an enemy if your roll <a href="../docs/gm_pages/making_enemies/index.html#the-baseline-mook" target="_blank">beats their Defense</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>If you hit, the target takes a box of damage.</b> Certain abilities and situations might change this to two boxes, change the type of damage from Physical to Mental, or produce effects in addition to damage.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Defense</h3>
      <p>
        <b>When you try to avoid harm, you roll a Skill</b>. Blocking an attack might use Strength. Dodging could use Agility. If you fail to avoid harm, you mark a box of damage. 
      </p>

      <h3>Turn Order</h3>
      <p>
        Turn order is decided at the beginning of some (but not all) conflicts. The GM will tell you to <b>roll Agility to determine when you act</b>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="kits" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>Kits</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Kits are powerful items you prepare each day</b>. They let you cast magic, practice alchemy, or wield enchanted weapons. At any given time you have <a href="../docs/gameplay/kits.html#kits-in-game-fiction" target="_blank">access to four kits</a> determined by your <a href="../docs/classes/index.html">class</a> and specialization.
      </p>

      <h3>Changing Kits</h3>
      <p>
        You can change Kits whenever you <a href="../docs/adventuring/exploration/index#making-camp">Make Camp</a>. You unlock new kits as your character becomes more <a href="../docs/more/advancement/index.html" target="_blank">experienced</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Types of Kits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Weapons</b>: Powerful equipment that adds additional effects to attacks.</li>
        <li><b>Talismans</b>: Artifacts that channel magical energy into spells.</li>
        <li><b>Alchemy</b>: Products of alchemic innovation, ranging from explosives to poisons.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Resources Tab -->
    <div id="resources" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="../docs/gameplay/resources.html">Resources</a> are caches of power that let you use special abilities and amplify your equipped kits. Like health, they are measured in boxes and recover when you <a href="../docs/adventuring/exploration/index#making-camp">Make Camp</a>.
