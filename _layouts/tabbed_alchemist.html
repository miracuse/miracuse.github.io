  <p>
    The Alchemist is a keen adventurer, keeping a watchful eye out for danger
    and a finger on the trigger. They carry a collection of handy items to throw
    at any problem that arises.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Skills</b>: Perception, Knowledge</li>
    <li><b>Kits</b>: Bombs, Drugs, Poisons, Tools</li>

  <h5>In combat...</h5>
  <p>
    The Alchemist keeps their distance, taking shots at range and spreading
    hazards across the battlefield with grenades. With prior warning they can
    hand out potions and poison weapons to prepare their party for trouble.
  </p>
  <h5>Socially...</h5>
  <p>
    The Alchemist specializes in debate. Their rhetorical technique is
    well-received by the wealthy and educated, but generally ineffectual towards
    less affluent listeners.
  </p>
  <h5>While exploring...</h5>
  <p>
    The Alchemist makes for an excellent lookout. Their sharp senses and wealth
    of lore will keep the party informed of approaching dangers well before they
    arrive.

  <h3>Uses Per Kit</h3>

  <p>
    Each Alchemist Kit has a limited number of uses based on the character's
    <strong><span style="color: #268bd2">Knowledge</span></strong
    >. Alchemists mark a box each time they use a specific Kit, and clear all
    boxes for all Kits when resting at camp.

  <h3>Sharing Items</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Drugs and Tools</b> can be safely shared with other party members.
    <b>Bombs and Poisons</b> require untrained users to roll
    <strong><span style="color: #268bd2">Knowledge</span></strong> to use
    safely.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="Bombs and Poisons" class="tabcontent">
  <h3><span style="color: #268bd2">Bombs and Poisons</span></h3>
  <h3>Bombs</h3>

  <p>
    In addition to being producing an area of effect attack, most bombs also
    create environmental hazards. Careful use of these can control the state of
    a battlefield.
  </p>

  <h3>Poisons</h3>

  <p>
    Poisons fall into two categories: Bloodstream Venoms and
    Contact Poisons.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Bloodstream Venoms</b> can be applied to weapons and ammunition. They produce
    additional effects on a successful attack.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Contact Poisons</b> need to be applied more subtly. Their effects trigger when
    they're breathed in, touched with bare skin, or consumed. They're generally
    ineffective in combat.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="Drugs and Tools" class="tabcontent">
  <h3><span style="color: #268bd2">Drugs and Tools</span></h3>
  <h3>Drugs</h3>

  <p>
    Drugs are items that player characters can consume to receive beneficial effects.
    Many restore Physical and Mental Health, allowing characters to continue adventuring
    long past their normal limits.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alchemists commonly hand out Drugs so that other characters will have them on hand
    during dangerous situations. The responsibility for managing who has what item at
    any given time belongs to the Alchemist.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Using a Drug in combat does take an Action.</li>
    <li>Incapacitated characters cannot use Drugs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tools</h3>

  <p>
    Tools are magical items that the Alchemist preps each day. Like other Alchemy
    Kits, they have a limited number of uses. However, their effects tend to be
    longer lived or permanent, depending on the item.
