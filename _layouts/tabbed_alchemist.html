  <h3><span style="color: #268bd2">The Alchemist</span></h3>
  <p>
    The Alchemist is a keen adventurer, keeping a watchful eye out for danger 
    and a finger on the trigger. They carry a collection of handy
    items to throw at any problem that arises.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Skills</b>: Perception, Knowledge</li>
    <li><b>Kits</b>: Bombs, Drugs, Poisons, Tools</li>

  <h5>In combat...</h5>
  <p>
    The Alchemist keeps their distance, taking shots at range and
    spreading hazards across the battlefield with grenades. With prior
    warning they can hand out potions and poison weapons to prepare their 
    party for trouble.
  </p>
  <h5>Socially...</h5>
  <p>
    The Alchemist specializes in debate. Their rhetorical technique is 
    well-received by the wealthy and educated, but generally ineffectual
    towards less affluent listeners.
  </p>
  <h5>While exploring...</h5>
  <p>
    The Alchemist makes for an excellent lookout. Their sharp senses and
    wealth of lore will keep the party informed of approaching dangers
    well before they arrive.

  <h3>Uses Per Rest</h3>

<p>
  Each Alchemist Kit has a limited number of uses based on the character's
  <strong><span style="color:#268bd2">Knowledge</span></strong>.
  Alchemists mark a box each time they use a specific Kit, and clear all boxes
  for all Kits when resting at camp.

<h3>What You Needed</h3>
<p>
  In the event that a character needs some item that might be unusual for them to carry (such as 
  a bag of ball bearings), they can roll <strong><span style="color:#268bd2">Knowledge</span></strong>
  to see whether or not they thought ahead and prepared that item ahead of time.
</p>

<h3>Sharing Items</h3>
<p>
  <b>Drugs and Tools</b> can be safely shared with other party members. <b>Bombs and Poisons</b> require untrained users to roll <strong><span style="color:#268bd2">Knowledge</span></strong> to use safely.
