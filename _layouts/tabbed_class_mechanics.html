     <h3>Uses Per Rest</h3>

<p>
  Each Alchemist Kit has a limited number of uses based on the character's
  <strong><span style="color:#268bd2">Knowledge</span></strong>.
  Alchemists mark a box each time they use a specific Kit, and clear all boxes
  for all Kits when resting at camp.
</p>

<h3>What You Needed</h3>
<p>
  In the event that a character needs some item that might be unusual for them to carry (such as 
  a bag of ball bearings), they can roll <strong><span style="color:#268bd2">Knowledge</span></strong>
  to see whether or not they thought ahead and prepared that item ahead of time.
</p>

<h3>Sharing Items</h3>
<p>
  <b>Drugs and Tools</b> can be safely shared with other party members. <b>Bombs and Poisons</b> require untrained users to roll <strong><span style="color:#268bd2">Knowledge</span></strong> to use safely.

     <h3>Fortune Points</h3>

<p>
  Soldiers have a number of <strong>Fortune Points</strong> equal to
  their <strong><span style="color:#d28445">Bravery</span></strong>.
  Fortune Points can be used to reroll any action the Soldier takes
  and take the better result.

<ul>
  <li>Fortune Points can only be used once per roll</li>
  <li>Fortune Points can be recovered by resting or through certain Kits </li>
  <li>Fortune Points can be used for any action where the player rolls, not just for combat</li>
</ul>

<h3>Morale</h3>

<p>
  Soldiers also have the ability to influence the morale of friends and foes using <strong><span style="color:#d28445">Bravery</span></strong>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Intimidation</strong> can force enemies to make distance or retreat.</li>
  <li><strong>Provoking</strong> enemies will incite them to ignore others and focus on the Soldier.</li>
  <li><strong>Rallying</strong> allies grants them Advantage on their next roll in combat.</li>
</ul>

<div id="Mage" class="tabcontent">
<h3 id="mage"><span style="color:#953553">The Mage</span></h3>

<h3>Cantrips</h3>

<p>The player chooses a spirit, describes an effect they want to achieve, and rolls <strong><span style="color:#953553">Aura</span></strong> to see how well it goes. Using a Mage Kit this way is called casting a <strong>Cantrip</strong>. 

<h3>Spellcasting</h3>

<p>
  Mages can combine two of their Kits to produce stronger and more complex effects. 
  Using Kits this way is called <strong>spellcasting</strong>, and requires 
  the caster to mark damage for one of their Mental Health boxes. 
  Having a higher <strong><span style="color:#953553">Focus</span></strong> allows
  Mages to cast more spells in a single day.

    <div id="Scoundrel" class="tabcontent">
<h3><span style="color:#90a959">The Scoundrel</span></h3>

<h3>Stealth</h3>

  <p>
    Scoundrels rarely attract notice unless they want to. By default, anyone not actively
    searching an area must have a higher <strong><span style="color:#268bd2">Perception</span></strong>
    than the Scoundrel's <strong><span style="color:#90a959">Cunning</span></strong> to detect them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, <strong>Stealth</strong> does not require a dice roll.
    Scoundrels are assumed to be hidden unless they're discovered, or someone is actively looking for them.
  </p>

<h3>Sneak Attacks</h3>

  <p>
    Attacking while in Stealth counts as an automatic 10, providing a +2 to the attack without a roll.
  </p>

<h3>I Know a Guy</h3>
  <p>
    A player can declare that his character <strong>Knows a Guy</strong> with some particular talent 
    or knowledge that can help the party. The player describes a new NPC, giving them a name and short
    background, before rolling <strong><span style="color:#90a959">Cunning</span></strong> to see how
    well-aquatinted their character is with the NPC.
