        <p>
          Hybrid classes lose some versatility by having fewer Kits. In
          exchange, they gain an additional Skill, and allow for Kit combinations that otherwise wouldn't be
          possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Players are encouraged to experiment with hybrid classes if they have
          a particular character concept in mind, such as “a thief that uses
          bombs” or “a warrior that knows magic”.
