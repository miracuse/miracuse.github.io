  <h3><span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">The Mage</span></h3>
  <p>
    The Mage forms pacts with the primal spirits of the world to perform
    miracles and spells. Some come by their magic through careful study, others
    through natural inclination or religious tradition. All Mages, regardless of
    their background, are marked by their dealings with spirits and become less
    human as they grow in power.

  <h3><span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic Basics</span></h3>

  <p>
    Mage Kits are deliberately open-ended, allowing players creative
    freedom to experiment with effects. A player might take <i>Spirit
    of Flame</i> and use it for:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Throwing fire at enemies.</li>
    <li>Making lights to help see while exploring in the dark.</li>
    <li>Creating a fire to keep warm during a snowstorm.</li>
    <li>Any other fire-related purpose.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How To (Cantrips)</h3>

  <p>
    To use a Mage Kit, the caster describe an effect that they're trying
    to achieve and rolls <strong><span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span></strong>
    to see how well it goes. More complex or powerful effects will have a higher difficulty,
    and some effects may not be possible. Using Kits this way is called casting a <b>Cantrip</b>.
  </p>

  <h3>Example: Spirit of Healing</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><b>(Easy)</b> Healing Physical damage, reviving an incapacitated ally.</li>
    <li><b>(Moderate)</b> Healing Physical injuries, treating poisons and diseases.</li>
    <li><b>(Impossible)</b> Healing Mental damage or injuries.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="Spellcasting" class="tabcontent">
  <h3><span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Spellcasting</span></h3>

  <p>
    <b>Spellcasting</b> is a more powerful, but more costly, way to use
    magic. Mages combine two different magic Kits to produce stronger and more 
    complex effects. Like Cantrips, the Mage rolls
    <strong><span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span></strong> to determine
    how successful the attempt was. They must also mark a point of Mental
    Health damage afterwards, reflecting the strain of using powerful magic.
  </p>

  <h3>Spellcasting Examples</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Fireball:</b> <i>(Flame + Air)</i> Inflicts damage in a wide area around a target and ignites everything nearby.</li>
    <li><b>Wall of Fire:</b> <i>(Flame + Warding)</i> Creates a wall of intense flame that persists for an hour.</li>
    <li><b>Fire Elemental:</b> <i>(Flame + Summoning)</i> Conjure a fire elemental to serve you for an hour.</li>
    <li><b>Flame Sword:</b> <i>(Flame + Metal)</i> Bind fire to a weapon, causing it to deal an additional point of damage on successful attacks for an hour.</li>
    <li><b>Blue Flame:</b> <i>(Flame + Thermos)</i> Create an extreme flame that can melt through metal with ease.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- <div id="Role" class="tabcontent">
  <h3><span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Mage Role</span></h3>
<h3>In combat...</h3>
  <p>
    The Mage unleashes unpredictable havoc on the enemy; striking foes blind,
    sending bolts of lighting across the battlefield, or casting any number of
    other impossibilities.
  </p>
  <h3>Socially...</h3>
  <p>
    The Mage speaks with supernatural charm. Weak-willed listeners find
    themselves hypnotically compelled by the sound of a Mage's voice, while
    those with sterner minds react with immediate distrust.
  </p>
  <h3>While exploring...</h3>
  <p>
    The Mage may call on their spirits to aid in finding hidden locations or
    communicating with the inhabitants of a foreign land. Their sixth sense can
    be helpful when dangerous magic is in the air.
