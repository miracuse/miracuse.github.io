<p>The <strong>Basic Mook</strong> is the simplest possible enemy. It could be a bandit, a wolf, a goblin,
or any other faceless NPC threatening the players.</p>

<p>Values on the left-side are Physical, while values on the right are Mental.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Health</strong>: Receiving this much damage from either Physical or Mental will take this character out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Defense</strong>: The Player must roll higher than this value to hurt this character.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Offense</strong>: The Player must roll this value or higher to avoid being hurt by this character.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Damage</strong>: The amount and type of damage this character does when they hit.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Reading the Bandit’s combat statistics we see that it isn’t very strong.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>They have one Physical and one Mental damage box.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>They take damage from any attack that rolls above a 0.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>They deal damage if a Player rolls a 0 or lower on Agility (the default for Physical attacks).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>When they deal damage, they force a player to mark a single Physical damage box.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>Basic Mooks are good for letting Players show off their skills against
easy targets. Fairly often though, you’ll want to give them a bigger
challenge in combat. The way that’s done is through <strong>Traits</strong>.</p>

<p>Traits change the combat stats of an enemy. A more comprehensive list
can be found on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NhqEjr0m4iug3n5NBa_rJ18LO9duhfDB2b4FYmKKZ4w/edit?usp=sharing">GM Helper Sheets</a>,
but the traits shown above are described here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tough</strong>: Add +2 Physical health boxes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Swift</strong>: Add +2 Physical defense</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mentalist</strong>: Add +2 Mental health boxes, attacks target Bravery and deal Mental damage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Grenadier</strong>: Gain one use of the Alchemist Kit <em>Greek Fire</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

</div>

<div id="Bosses" class="tabcontent">
<h3 id="bosses">Bosses</h3>

<p><strong>Bosses</strong> are the stronger counterpart to Mooks. Besides higher stats, two distinguishing
characteristics of bosses are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Multiple Turns</strong>: Bosses take multiple actions in combat, as though they were two characters instead of one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Stages</strong>: Bosses gain and lose abilities after taking sufficient damage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Bandit Chief above has two stages. Instead of being taken out when they run out of health,
they move to their second stage, dealing an additional point of damage on successful attacks but
becoming less accurate.</p>

<div id="Advice" class="tabcontent">

<h3 id="advice">Advice</h3>

<p>Keeping combat lively and interesting isn’t easy. This section provides tips to keep
the players engaged.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fiction First</em></strong></p>

<p>Bear in mind that most fights aren’t to the death. Many enemies have their own objectives.
Bandits will flee if they’re losing, intelligent creatures will target Mages with arrows,
and guards will protect the vulnerable members of their party.</p>

<p><strong><em>Drama</em></strong></p>

<p>Take action if you find that a fight has become dull and predictable. If the enemies are losing badly, break out of the skirmish and describe them running away or the players quickly mopping things up. If neither the party nor the enemies are giving any ground, introduce a complication. Have a third party stumble on the scene, or describe some impending threat like a river of lava slowly rising.</p>
