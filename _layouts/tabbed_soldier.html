  <p>
    The Soldier is a warrior without peer. They may be knights, bandits,
    infantrymen, or come from other walks of life. What makes one a Soldier is
    not their profession but their skill at arms, courage, and a surprising
    amount of luck.

<div id="Role" class="tabcontent">
  <h3><span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Soldier Role</span></h3>
  <h3>In combat...</h3>
  <p>
    The Soldier is often at the frontlines, terrorizing enemies and bringing
    ruin to those that approach. Their
    <b><span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span></b>
    makes them dangerous and hardy opponents.
  </p>
  <h3>Socially...</h3>
  <p>
    The Soldier is an imposing figure. They carry an air of
    <b><span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Bravery</span></b>
    that impresses like-minded persons and cows others. Less militant audiences
    may be put off by their demeanor, seeing them as brutish and curt.
  </p>
  <h3>While exploring...</h3>
  <p>
    The Soldier provides raw muscle, breaking down obstacles by sheer force.
    Their abundant luck has saved many a party from unexpected traps and
    ambushes.

<div id="Techniques" class="tabcontent">
  <h3><span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Techniques</span></h3>
  <p>
    Techniques are Kits that modify attacks. They add additional
    effects, such as increasing damage, hitting multiple enemies, or
    targeting multiple enemies at once. For example, the <i>Cleave</i>
    Kit might be used to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Swing an axe through a horde of goblins.</li>
    <li>Shoot a volley of arrows at several bandits.</li>
    <li>Throw a javelin that destroys cover and strikes the assassin hiding behind it.</li>
    <li>Ricochet a thrown shield off of one enemy and into another.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Empowered Techniques</h3>
  <p>
    In addition to their passive effect, Techniques can also be amplified
    or mixed together by expending Fortune Points. 
  </p>

  <ul>
      <li><b>Cleave (Amplified)</b>: Make an attack against every enemy in the room.</li>
      <li><b>Cleave + Sunder</b>: Make an area-of-effect attack that deals additional 
        Physical damage while destroying armor and weapons.</li>
      <li><b>Cleave + Smite</b>: Make an area-of-effect attack that sends enemies flying.</li>
      <li><b>Cleave + Spellbreak</b>: Obliterate a horde of zombies by cutting through the magic that animates them.</li>
  </ul>
