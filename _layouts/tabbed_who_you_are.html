        <p>
          The Alchemist is a keen adventurer, keeping a watchful eye out for danger 
          and a finger on the trigger. They carry a collection of handy
          items to throw at any problem that arises.

        <h5>In combat...</h5>
        <p>
          The Alchemist keeps their distance, taking shots at range and
          spreading hazards across the battlefield with grenades. With prior
          warning they can hand out potions and poison weapons to prepare their 
          party for trouble.
        </p>
        <h5>Socially...</h5>
        <p>
          The Alchemist specializes in debate. Their rhetorical technique is 
          well-received by the wealthy and educated, but generally ineffectual
          towards less affluent listeners.
        </p>
        <h5>While exploring...</h5>
        <p>
          The Alchemist makes for an excellent lookout. Their sharp senses and
          wealth of lore will keep the party informed of approaching dangers
          well before they arrive.

        <h3><span style="color: #d28445">The Soldier</span></h3>
        <p>
          The Soldier is a warrior without peer. They may be knights, bandits,
          infantrymen, or come from other walks of life. What makes one a
          Soldier is not their profession but their skill at arms, courage, and
          a surprising amount of luck.

        <h5>In combat...</h5>
        <p>
          The Soldier is often at the frontlines, terrorizing enemies and bringing
          ruin to those that approach. They may serve as a vanguard preventing
          foes from reaching more fragile members of the party.
        </p>
        <h5>Socially...</h5>
        <p>
          The Soldier is an imposing figure. They carry an air of self assurance
          that impresses like-minded persons and cows others. Less militant
          audiences may be put off by their demeanor, seeing them as brutish and
          curt.
        </p>
        <h5>While exploring...</h5>
        <p>
          The Soldier provides raw muscle, breaking down obstacles by sheer force.
          Their abundant luck has saved many a party from unexpected traps and ambushes.

      <div id="Mage" class="tabcontent">
        <h3><span style="color: #953553">The Mage</span></h3>
        <p>
          The Mage forms pacts with the primal spirits of the world to perform
          miracles and spells. Some come by their magic through careful study,
          others through natural inclination or religious tradition. All Mages,
          regardless of their background, are marked by their
          dealings with spirits and become less human as they grow in power.

        <hr />

        <h5>In combat...</h5>
        <p>
          The Mage unleashes unpredictable havoc on the enemy; striking foes
          blind, sending bolts of lighting across the battlefield, or casting
          any number of other impossibilities.
        </p>
        <h5>Socially...</h5>
        <p>
          The Mage speaks with supernatural charm. Weak-willed listeners find
          themselves hypnotically compelled by the sound of a Mage's voice, while
          those with sterner minds react with immediate distrust.
        </p>
        <h5>While exploring...</h5>
        <p>
          The Mage may call on their spirits to aid in finding hidden
          locations or communicating with the inhabitants of a foreign land.
          Their sixth sense can be helpful when dangerous magic is in the air.

        <p>
          The Scoundrel is a master of misdirection. They blend in with crowds
          and shadows, only revealing themselves when the time is right. Many
          employ their talents as hunters or merchants, though it's just as
          common to see them working as thieves and assassins.

          <tr>
            <td>

        <hr />

        <h5>In combat...</h5>
        <p>
          The Scoundrel waits for the right opportunity to dispatch an enemy,
          showing a preference for dangerous targets like mages. Once exposed
          they might make a hasty getaway, or throw themselves into the fight
          with a frenzy of quick strikes.
        </p>
        <h5>Socially...</h5>
        <p>
          The Scoundrel bewilders and confuses with fast-talk. Perhaps because
          of their ability to present an friendly face, many also have an
          affinity for working with animals. Listeners that prefer a
          straightforward response will quickly tire of the Scoundrel's evasive
          speech.
        </p>
        <h5>While exploring...</h5>
        <p>
          The Scoundrel is nearly always the scout of a party. They move unseen
          through dangerous areas, ever ready to book a fast retreat should
          danger arise.
