Advancement in *Miracuse* is tied to the development of a nearby village or town. The artifacts and allies adventurers find while exploring can be used to grow the village, which will help the village to support the party.

### Artifacts

Artifacts represent any object, magical or technological, of significant power. Some Artifacts can be used to improve the village. Others can be wielded by characters like a Kit.

| Kit Type | Kit       | Description                                                                                                                      |
| -------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Artifact | Sun Sword | A perpetually burning sword. Deals +1 damage on successful attacks, and grants advantage when defending against magical attacks. |

A list of example Artifacts can be found on the Game Sheet.

### Creating New Kits

When the **<span style="color:#953553">Prudence</span>**  Village Skill is increased, each player can invent a new Kit by working with their GM. **Characters are still limited to four Kits at any one time.**

| Kit Type | Kit            | Description                            |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Black    | Spirit of Hate | Inspires anger, up to mindless frenzy. |
