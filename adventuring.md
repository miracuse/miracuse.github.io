# Adventuring

Most situations can be resolved using the Skill rolls described in [What You Do](what_you_do.md). That being said, there are a few common scenarios that have additional rules.

* **Persuasion**
* **Scouting**
* **Skirmishes**
* **Camping**
<!-- * **Luck** -->

### Persuasion

Anytime you want to convince a non-player character of something, you'll need to roll an appropriate Skill. Each class has their own approach to persuasion with some being better suited to particular situations.

| Skill                                            | Use                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **<span style="color:#268bd2">Knowledge</span>** | Debate, rhetorical skill, and logic.            |
| **<span style="color:#d28445">Bravery</span>**   | Challenge, intimidate, and impress.             |
| **<span style="color:#953553">Aura</span>**      | Awe, command, and speaking with spirits.        |
| **<span style="color:#90a959">Cunning</span>**   | Deceit, fast talking, and working with animals. |

### Scouting

Players looking to explore dangerous areas will need to be quiet and observant. When scouting in groups, do the following.

* Roll **<span style="color:#90a959">Cunning</span>** and take the **lowest** result of everyone participating
* Roll **<span style="color:#268bd2">Perception</span>** and take the **highest** result of everyone participating

Better Cunning results will ensure that the party is not discovered, while better Perception rolls will reveal information about the surroundings (including the possibility of traps).

### Skirmishes

A skirmish is any situation where several characters need to take different actions and **turn order matters**. The most common scenario is combat, but other possibilities might include fixing a sinking ship or racing a rival adventuring party for treasure.

* Roll **<span style="color:#90a959">Agility</span>** to determine the order that characters will act.
* On their turn, characters can take one action (usually a single roll of the dice).

### Camping

Making camp gives characters the opportunity to recover and change their Kits. However, resting in dangerous areas should be accompanies by an overnight watch.

* Two characters roll **<span style="color:#268bd2">Perception</span>** and take the **lowest** result

Poor Perception results may lead to unexpected ambushes while most of the party is sleeping.
