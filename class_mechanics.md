# Class Mechanics

### <span style="color:#268bd2">Alchemist</span>

Alchemist Kits have a limited number of uses based on the character's **<span style="color:#268bd2">Knowledge</span>**. Alchemists mark a box each time they use a Kit, and clear all boxes when resting at camp.

| Knowledge | Uses per Rest                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| 0         | &#9744; &#9744;                 |
| 1         | &#9744; &#9744; &#9744;         |
| 2         | &#9744; &#9744; &#9744; &#9744; |
| ...       | ...                             |


### <span style="color:#d28445">Soldier</span>

Soldiers have a number of Fortune Points equal to their **<span style="color:#d28445">Bravery</span>**. Fortune Points can be used to reroll any action the Soldier takes.

* Fortune Points can only be used once per roll
* Fortune Points recover after resting to a maximum of the Soldier's Bravery
* Several Soldier Kits augment Fortune Points by offering more methods to acquire points besides rest


### <span style="color:#953553">Mage</span>

Mages can combine their Kits to produce stronger and more complex effects.

The user chooses two spirits, describes an effect they want to achieve, and rolls **<span style="color:#953553">Aura</span>** to see how well it goes. Using Kits in this fashion is called spellcasting, and requires the user to mark one Mental Health box.

| Spell           | Description                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fireball        | Spirit of Fire + Air; an area-of-effect Physical attack that sets the surroundings on fire.           |
| Paralyzing Fear | Spirit of Fear + Binding; an area-of-effect Mental attack that prevents enemies from moving.          |
| Stone Wall      | Spirit of Earth + Warding; creates a wall of rock to serve as a barricade.                            |
| Muted Blur      | Spirit of Darkness + Silence: an area-of-effect gives Advantage on Cunning rolls for going unnoticed. |


### <span style="color:#90a959">Scoundrel</span>

Scoundrels are difficult to find unless they want to be found. They blend into crowds and shadows with ease.

By default, anyone not actively searching an area must have a higher **<span style="color:#268bd2">Perception</span>** than the Scoundrel's **<span style="color:#90a959">Cunning</span>** to detect them. No rolls are required. 

Besides going unnoticed, being in stealth provides several benefits:

* Attacks from stealth do not require rolls, and count as an automatic 10
* Enemies will not target the Scoundrel in combat
