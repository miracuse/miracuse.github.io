# Class Mechanics

### <span style="color:#268bd2">Alchemist</span>

Alchemist Kits have a limited number of uses based on the character's **<span style="color:#268bd2">Knowledge</span>**. Alchemists mark a box each time they use a Kit, and clear all boxes when resting at camp.

| Knowledge | Uses per Rest                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| 0         | &#9744; &#9744;                 |
| 1         | &#9744; &#9744; &#9744;         |
| 2         | &#9744; &#9744; &#9744; &#9744; |
| ...       | ...                             |


### <span style="color:#d28445">Soldier</span>

Soldiers can provoke or intimidate enemies during skirmishes using **<span style="color:#d28445">Bravery</span>**. 

* **Provoke:** Incite an enemy to attack you, disregarding others.
* **Intimidate:** Scare off an enemy, forcing them to retreat or create distance.

### <span style="color:#953553">Mage</span>

Magescan combine their Kits to produce stronger and more complex effects. The user chooses two spirits, describes an effect they want to achieve, and rolls **<span style="color:#953553">Aura</span>** to see how well it goes. Using Kits in this fashion is called spellcasting, and causes the user to mark one Mental box.

| Spell           | Description                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fireball        | Spirit of Fire + Air; an area-of-effect Physical attack that sets the surroundings on fire.           |
| Paralyzing Fear | Spirit of Fear + Binding; an area-of-effect Mental attack that prevents enemies from moving.          |
| Stone Wall      | Spirit of Earth + Warding; creates a wall of rock to serve as a barricade.                            |
| Muted Blur      | Spirit of Darkness + Silence: an area-of-effect gives Advantage on Cunning rolls for going unnoticed. |


### <span style="color:#90a959">Scoundrel</span>

In addition to their own capabilities as quick and stealthy characters, Scoundrels can borrow the Kits and Skills of other classes to a limited extent. A versatile player can switch from strongman to mage to thief as the situation changes.
