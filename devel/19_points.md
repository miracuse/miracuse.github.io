1.) What is your game about?

> Fast-paced swords-and-sorcery adventure, with an emphasis on collaborative storytelling.



2.) What do the characters do?

> Fight, explore, and socialize using their unique set of character traits (Skills and Kits).



3.) What do the players (including the GM if there is one) do?

> They work together to provide an interactive, improvisational narrative session. The GM sets the scene and arbitrates rulings. The Players react to the scene with creative problem solving.



4.) How does your setting (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?

> _Miracuse_ is general enough to be adapted to settings that Players are familiar with (Eberron, Forgotten Realms, etc.) However, it also provides a loose backdrop for GM's interesting in ad-libbing their own settings.



5.) How does the Character Creation of your game reinforce what your game is about?

> Character Creation is designed to target different types of Players. Those with a preference for jumping into the game can do so with ease. Those with an interest in mechanical depth can spend time customizing their character. Both of these options reinforce one of _Miracuse's_ design goals: to accommodate multiple kinds of Players, rather than play styles.



6.) What types of behaviors/styles of play does your game reward (and punish if necessary)?

> _Miracuse_ favors creative problem solving and group participation. It is not particularly well-suited to tactical wargaming or simulationist survival.



7.) How are behaviors and styles of play rewarded or punished in your game?

> Skills and Kits, two of the primary game mechanics, are designed to encourage open-ended exploration. They offer general guidelines for "what can be done", but don't narrowly prescribe a list of allowable actions. 



8.) How are the responsibilities of narration and credibility divided in your game?

> The GM is the primary steward of the game, creating settings, NPC's, and other features of the world. Players are encouraged to participate as well, with some mechanics ("I Know a Guy", "What You Needed") giving them a portion of narrative power over the world.



9.) What does your game do to command the players' attention, engagement, and participation? (i.e. What does the game do to make them care?)

> The first tool of engagement are the Players' characters. Simply creating a character is an enjoyable exercise for many, and fosters an interest in using that character to experience the world.
> 
> The second tool is the character sheet. A modest number of affordances let Players see their status without excess cognitive load (Health, Resources, Equipped Kits). Players are often brash when their status is in good condition, and become increasingly cunning as they deplete their characters. Many derive a sense of accomplishment from clever uses of Skills/Kits.



10.) What are the resolution mechanics of your game like?

> A dice roll and a Skill value checked against an improvised difficulty threshold.



11.) How do the resolution mechanics reinforce what your game is about?

> Unlike Pathfinder or similar systems that reward stacking bonuses and careful system mastery, _Miracuse_ aims for simplicity. Using an axe is not noticeably different from using a sword, or a gun, or other weapon. In the same vein, attacking is not a unique type of action. It follows the same resolution system as climbing a wall or casting a spell.

12.) Do characters in your game advance? If so, how?

13.) How does the character advancement (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?

14.) What sort of product or effect do you want your game to produce in or for the players?

15.) What areas of your game receive extra attention and color? Why?

16.) Which part of your game are you most excited about or interested in? Why?

17.) Where does your game take the players that other games can’t, don’t, or won’t?

18.) What are your publishing goals for your game?

19.) Who is your target audience?
