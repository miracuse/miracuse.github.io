# Alchemist Writeup

The Alchemist has the most burst potential of any class but also the most demanding resource management. Similar to the Mage, they're capable of producing major effects on command, and have a larger pool of resources to do so. Unlike the Mage, Alchemists lack cantrips. Once their Charges are expended, their Kits become useless.

### Perception

> Offense, Awareness

The Alchemist's attack skill is Perception. Their fighting styles tend to rely on observation and accuracy. Similarly, Perception lets Players deduce information. It can be used to determine weaknesses, spot traps, and notice odd behavior in NPC's.

### Knowledge

> Social, Resource, Awareness

The Alchemists's social skill is Knowledge. They use it to employ rhetorical strategies when persuading others and to recognize when others are presenting faulty arguments. It determines the number of uses each of their Kits have. And, lastly, it sees use whenever a Player is trying to recall information about the game world.

### Charges

The Alchemist's resource is **Charges**, calculated using their Knowledge Skill. Each Alchemist Kit has its own resource track, giving them rough equivalent of 16 "spells" per rest. These effects tend to be fairly powerful, though not quite as versatile as magic. 

### Items 



### Skill Point Advancement

* **Perception** will make an Alchemist better at aiming their weapons. It will also improve their ability to acquire information, either passively or actively. 

* **Knowledge** will provide additional Charges for each Kit. It also empowers an Alchemist's social skills.

Other interesting options might include:

* **Strength** to add Physical health and defense to the otherwise vulnerable Alchemist.

* **Presence** for the Enchanter subclass, allowing them to cast more spells using the *Spirit of Animation* and *Spirit of Transmutation* Kits.

* **Cunning** to add Stealth and Prep to the Alchemist's repertoire, expanding their burst potential even further.
