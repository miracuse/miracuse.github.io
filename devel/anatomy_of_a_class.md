# Anatomy of a Class

### Classes

The working definition of a [Class](../docs/classes/index.html) in _Miracuse_ is an allocation of skills.

- All **Alchemists** are knowledgeable and perceptive.

- All **Soldiers** are strong and brave.

- All **Mages** are magical and have powerful presences.

- All **Scoundrels** are quick and cunning.

Each class provides a balanced foundation for a new character. They have a skill to attack with, a skill to persuade with, and a resource of some kind (potions, fortune, etc.)

### Custom Classes

[Custom Classes](../docs/more/custom_class.html) are player-defined skill allocations. Having the option allows interested players to engage with the system on a deeper level, but sacrifices the established balance of the base classes.

- **Paladins** are strong, and also a little brave, a little magical, and have some presence.

- **Myrmidons** are quick and strong.

- **Scholars** are knowledgeable, and also a little perceptive, a little cunning, and have some presence.

Notice the advantages and disadvantages of each custom class. **Paladins** will be more versatile than other characters, but their weaker magical and social skills will change how they interact with the game. **Myrmidons** will be among the best fighters with the ability to dodge and block. However, they have no social skills whatsoever. **Scholars** have the opposite problem. They have plenty of skills for exploration and support, but very little combat ability.
