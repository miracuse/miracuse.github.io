# Anatomy of a Class

### Classes

The working definition of a [Class](../docs/classes/index.html) in _Miracuse_ is an allocation of skills. 

- All **Alchemists** are knowledgeable and perceptive.

- All **Soldiers** are strong and brave.

- All **Mages** are magical and have powerful presences.

- All **Scoundrels** are quick and cunning.

Each class provides a balanced foundation for a new character. They have a skill to attack with, a skill to persuade with, and a resource of some kind (potions, fortune, etc.)

### Custom Classes

[Custom Classes](../docs/more/custom_class.html) are player-defined skill allocations. Having the option allows interested players to engage with the system on a deeper level, but sacrifices the established balance of the base classes.  

- **Paladins** are strong, and also a little brave, a little magical, and have some presence.

- **Myrmidons** are quick and strong.

- **Scholars** are knowledgeable, and also a little perceptive, a little cunning, and have some presence.

Notice the advantages and disadvantages of each custom class. **Paladins** will be more versatile than other characters, but their weaker magical and social skills will change how they interact with the game. **Myrmidons** will be among the best fighters with the ability to dodge and block. However, they have no social skills whatsoever. **Scholars** have the opposite problem. They have plenty of skills for exploration and support, but very little combat ability.

### Specializations

Specializations are thematically similar kits that relate to a profession or trade of some sort. They are intended to provide a cohesive set of abilities. 

- **Priests** have six kits built around the concept of divine magic. They can heal, speak with the dead, and banish evil.

- **Legionnaires** have six kits built around the concept of an ancient Roman infantryman. They have spears, shields, and portable cement for construction. 

- **Assassins** have six kits built around the concept of an infiltrator. They have poisons, shadow magic, and weapons that don't leave a trail.

- **Corsairs** have six kits built around the concept of a swashbuckling sky pirate. They have a sword, a gun, and tools that help with survival during ship combat.
