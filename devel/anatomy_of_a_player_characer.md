# Anatomy of a Player Character

### Base Elements

> **Skills** (What You're Good At)
>
> **Kits** (What You Can Do)

The two most basic elements of a character, insofar as their game mechanics are concerned, include their **Skills** and their **Kits**. The former represents what a character is good at. The latter concerns what a character is capable of.

| Name    | "Skills"             | "Kits"                    |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Corwin  | Strong, Devious      | Magic Sword, Regeneration |
| Sabriel | Cautious, Perceptive | Necromancy, Magic Bells   |
| Kaladin | Tough, Brave         | Magic Spear, Flight       |

### Derived Elements

> **Health**
>
> **Resources**

Derived elements are those parts of a character which directly result from Skills and Kits. Health is derived from the Strength and Bravery skills. Resources (like potions) are derived from other skills.

### Identity

Also called High Concept in _FATE_. A character's personality and motivations are independent of the other elements, but are often informed by them. We could imagine that shuffling the earlier example table would produce interesting results:

| Name    | "Skills"             | "Kits"                    |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Corwin  | Strong, Devious      | Magic Spear, Flight       |
| Sabriel | Cautious, Perceptive | Magic Sword, Regeneration |
| Kaladin | Tough, Brave         | Necromancy, Magic Bells   |

Changing a character's kits doesn't change their personality, but it does change how they interact with the world. If Sabriel's main tool for dealing with issues was a magic sword, would she still be inclined to think her way through most problems? Would Kaladin still throw himself headfirst into every fight if his tools were better suited to ambushes and subtle tricks?

### Other Thoughts

##### Skill Granularity

_Miracuse_ provides a list of of skills to choose from when determining "What You're Good At". Other systems offer variation in the granularity of that decision. _D&D_, for example, splits "What You're Good At" into Attributes, Skills, and Proficiency Bonuses. The result being far more knobs and dials to twist when creating a character. In contrast, _FATE Accelerated_ distills the concept down to Approaches. A character is good at being "Forceful" or "Graceful", which provides a very broad interpretation.

##### Kit Granularity

A deliberate design decision was made to bundle kits together in groups of six, called **Specializations**. The advantage of this approach is that it creates firmer character concepts by establishing common professions. Players and GM's can draw from a shared pool identity of what a Wizard is, or a Sapper, or a Knight. Take Templars as an example.

> "Templars have kits that suppress magic and work especially well on magic monsters."
>
> Alright. Why? What reason is there, in the game world, for Templars to exist as a profession?
>
> "Mages are dangerous and scary. If a Mage breaks the law, you need someone that can bring them to justice."
>
> There we go. Now we have something more substantial than a collection of anti-magic kits. There's an idea behind Templars, a bit of lore that might inform the identity of a Templar.
>
> Did your character become a Templar because they hate magic? Or maybe a Wizard burned down their village? Or their long-lost sister fell in with a crowd of sorcerers and they picked up the trade to attempt a rescue?
