### Specializations

Specializations are thematically similar kits that relate to a profession or trade of some sort. They are intended to provide a cohesive set of abilities.

- **Priests** have six kits built around the concept of divine magic. They can heal, speak with the dead, and banish evil.

- **Legionnaires** have six kits built around the concept of an ancient Roman infantryman. They have spears, shields, and portable cement for construction.

- **Assassins** have six kits built around the concept of an infiltrator. They have poisons, shadow magic, and weapons that don't leave a trail.

- **Corsairs** have six kits built around the concept of a swashbuckling sky pirate. They have a sword, a gun, and tools that help with survival during ship combat.


### Specializations as Character Concepts

Although specializations are only part of a character's makeup, they do a fair amount of work by specifying the kinds of equipment a character has access to. It's worth taking a few minutes to imagine the sorts of things common to every adventurer.

* **Weapon**: Every specialization should have some way to attack. Combat is a sizable part of _Miracuse_, and every character should have the ability to participate.

* **Tools of the Trade**: Most professions, if not all professions, are affiliated with tools. These should be represented in a specialization's kits. Knights should have holy swords, for example.
