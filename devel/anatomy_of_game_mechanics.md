### Anatomy of Game Mechanics

##### The Fundamental Mechanic

The core mechanic is **Dice Roll + Skill Level**. Every other mechanic, from combat to persuasion to kits, is built on top of this one.

##### Subsystems

Subsystems are used when the fundamental mechanic isn't enough. These are scenarios where adding additional rules can provide some value in the game.

- **Combat and Health**: The game benefits from having more formal rules for describing conflict. These rules are still based on the fundamental mechanics, but include guidelines for how much damage a character can take, how to organize turn order when timing matters, etc.

- **Magic and Alchemy**: Without boundaries, magic and alchemy could be narratively used to do anything. The creation of magic and alchemy systems (ala Kits) governs what is and is not possible.

- **Resources**: Resource management adds a tactical layer to _Miracuse_. Players know that they have a small pool of "big, flashy moves" that they need to save for the right moment. The size of this pool is determined by their Skill Levels, and the "big, flashy moves" available are dependent on kits. As players burn through their resource pools they become more cautious and naturally look for in-game areas to rest.
