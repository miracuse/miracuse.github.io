# Mage Writeup

The quintessential magic user. Their virtually unlimited use of cantrips facilitates a creative playstyle. Spell casting can change the course of a session, but the direct cost to the character's health can result in a quick incapacitation.

### Magic

> Offense, Magic

The Mage's attack skill is, appropriately, Magic. Many of their Kits can be used to cause harm to enemies. They might also be used to solve quite a few different challenges depending on which Kits are equipped.

### Presence

> Social, Health

The Mage's social skill is Presence, which functions as applied weirdness. Players might use it to perform a "Jedi Mind Trick", hypnotizing weak-willed peasants or creating a sense of unease. Presence also increases Mental Health, which is expended to cast spells.

### Mental Health

The Mage's resource is **Mental Health**. This gives their playstyle an element of risk. Spells tend to be flashier and more versatile than Techniques, but each use increases the likelihood that the user will be incapacitated.

### Spirits

Spirits are a type of Kit that Mages (and to a lesser extent Scoundrels) have. They're intentionally open-ended to facilitate creative play.

Most Spirit Kits imply dominion over an element or an aspect. Something like _Spirit of Gravity_ allows Mages to perform minor manipulations of gravity without a cost. Larger manipulations come at a cost of Mental Health and a second Spirit Kit.

### Skill Point Advancement

-   **Magic** improves the efficacy of all magical abilities, both cantrips and spells. Similarly, it improves a Mage's ability to hurt enemies with magic.

-   **Presence** will provide more Mental Health, which allows for more spells between rests. It also reinforces a Mage's social ability to hypnotize and awe others.

Other interesting options might include:

-   **Strength** to increase a Mage's limited Physical health and defense.

-   **Agility** to increase defense, and to react with magic before others can take their actions.

-   **Bravery** to gain Fortune Points for use in rerolling spells, which are costly to cast.
