# People: The “Who”

People encompasses all the characters in the world besides the players. Some may be friendly, others hostile, but they are all played by the GM.

- **Mooks** are low-level enemies that might exhaust player characters, but aren’t likely to defeat them.

- **Bosses** are stronger enemies that pose a serious threat.
