# Cantrips and Spells Revisited

**Cantrips**, originally discussed on the [Mage](../../classes/mage/index.md) page, represent any use of a Kit with the "Magic" tag. This might mean throwing fire using _Spirit of Flame_, healing wounds with _Spirit of Restoration_, or making a hasty retreat with _Spirit of Locomotion_.

Many Players, faced with the sheer number of options, are likely to have the same questions about Cantrips.

-   What can I do with a cantrip?

-   What _can't_ I do with a cantrip?

-   How powerful can a Cantrip be?

-   How powerful can a Spell be?

Much of this is ultimately up to the GM's judgement. But in the interests of making their lives easier, examples are provided here.

**_Example: Spirit of Restoration_**

Healing cantrips can treat Physical damage and identify larger problems. Healing spells can treat Physical injuries, create area-of-effect healing, and produce similar outcomes. No magic is able to treat Mental damage or Injuries. Despite that, keep in mind FATE's [Silver Rule](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/what-do-during-play#the-silver-rule): never let the rules get in the way of what makes narrative sense.

**Cantrips**:

-   _Cure Wounds_: Restore a number of Physical boxes equal your roll result. Requires physical contact with the target. Cannot treat Injuries.

-   _Mending_: Attempt to repair a simple damaged object. For example, a broken sword can be mended, but a broken clock would too complex for this spell.

-   _Discern Affliction_: Attempt to discover the source of an affliction, such as poison, disease, or curses.

**Spells**:

-   _Restoration_: Restoration + Divination. Focus healing on a specific Injury, poison, or disease, removing it.

-   _Healing Word_: Restoration + Language. Speak a powerful word that restores Physical boxes to all who hear it, similar to Cure Wounds.

-   _Remove Curse_: Restoration + Abjuration. Remove difficult afflictions caused by magic, such as lycanthropy and vampirism.

-   _Bless Water_: Restoration + Water. Imbue a pool of water with healing energy. Until the next dawn, anyone submerged in the water will have their Physical damage healed and any magical effects removed.

-   _Regeneration_: Restoration + Reinforcement. Gradually recover from harm throughout the day, clearing one Physical box every two hours in game, for the next 24 hours.

**_Example: Spirit of Earth_**

Most elemental magic can be used to attack in one way or another. That might mean lobbing stones, lashing someone with sand, or doing something similar. Mechanically, these will all have the same effect of dealing one Physical damage on a successful hit, but narratively they're distinct. You can't lash someone with sand if there is no sand around. Creating a pillar of stone means that there's now a pillar of stone on the battlefield.

**Cantrips**:

-   _Stone Pillar_: Strike an enemy by forcing a pillar of stone to erupt from the ground into their body.

-   _Create Tunnel_: Reshape dirt or stone, slowly creating a stable opening to walk through.

-   _Compact_: Harden loose dirt, sand, or mud into a solid surface.

**Spells**:

-   _Sinkhole_: Earth + Water. Transmute an area of solid ground into quicksand.

-   _Dustdevil_: Earth + Wind. Create a blinding whirlwind of debris that causes Physical damage and blocks sight.

-   _Conjure Ceramics_: Earth + Fire. Instantly create ceramic objects from fired clay, such as armor plates or fire-proofing.

-   _Wall of Stone_: Earth + Abjuration. Raise a sturdy wall of stone.

-   _Summon Earth Elemental_: Earth + Summoning. Bind an earth spirit to a body of rock, sand, or dirt, creating a servant. The elemental falls apart after 24 hours.

**_Example: Spirit of Light_**

Mages aren't the only class capable of using magic. Several subclasses have a Kit or two that lets them dabble in magic at a cost. A few non-Mage subclasses are even able to cast spells. Higher level characters with Kits from multiple subclasses can create some unusual spells from the combinations available.

**Cantrips**:

-   _Silent Image_: Create an immobile phantom illusion that appears real at a glance, but falls apart when touched. The larger and more detailed the illusion, the more difficult the roll required.

-   _Blinding Light_: Create a painfully bright light that blinds those who look directly at it. Does not deal damage, but does inflict blindness.

-   _Conjure Binoculars_: Bend light between your hands, allowing you to see things from a great distance.

**Spells**:

-   _Major Illusion_: Light + Sound. Create an illusion that looks and sounds real, capable of motion and speech. You can puppet the illusion with small hand gestures. The illusion collapses after one hour.

-   _Flashbang_: Light + Sound. Blind and deafen targets in a wide area. Inflicts Mental damage as well as blindness and deafness.

-   _Searing Light_: Light + Reinforcement. Focus light into a narrow piercing beam, setting enemies ablaze and inflicting lethal damage to the undead.

-   _Light of Truth_: Light + Divination. Scour the area with divine light, burning away illusions, revealing hidden objects, and compelling those within to only speak the truth.
