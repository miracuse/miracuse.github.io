# Soldier Writeup

While all of the classes have combat capabilities, the Soldier specializes in fighting. They have the most health of any class, have a high defense, and can change their attack behavior using Techniques.

### Strength

> Offense, Defense, Health

The Soldier's attack skill is Strength. In addition to determining how often they successfully attack, Strength can be used to defend against many different kinds of harm. It can also be used while exploring to breakthrough obstacles or otherwise overcome challenges through raw muscle.

### Bravery

> Social, Resource

The Soldier's social skill is Bravery. With it they can provoke, intimidate, and inspire NPC's. Players should find that those social behaviors have a nice synergy with common Soldier character concepts (knights, gladiators, mercenaries, etc.)

### Fortune Points

The Soldier's resource is **Fortune Points**, calculated using their Bravery Skill. Fortune Points allow Players to reroll the dice for any challenge one time. This supports the narrative of a highly-resilient character, and gives Soldiers some much needed versatility.

### Techniques

Techniques are a type of Kit that Soldiers (and to a lesser extent Scoundrels) have. They consist of a few different parts:

- A "free" augmentation to basic attacks (like knockdown or area-of-effect radius).

- An upgrade to some particular non-combat application (like Advantage on intimidation or inspiration).

- The ability to amplify the augmentation or combine it with the augmentations of other Technique Kits, at a cost of one Fortune Point.

Techniques are intended to give the Soldier some tactical ability in combat. All of the classes have some means to deal damage; but Techniques allow Players to change the narrative of a fight while still dishing out harm.

### Skill Point Advancement

- **Strength** will make a Soldier better at striking, better at defending, and give them higher health.

- **Bravery** will provide additional Fortune Points, allowing more techniques between rests. It also empowers a Soldier's social skills.

Other interesting options might include:

- **Magic** for the Myrmidon subclass, allowing them to use _Spirit of Chance_ without burning Fortune Points.

- **Cunning** to gain some stealth ability.

- **Presence** for the Knight subclass, to leverage _Iron Will_ for a large pool of Fortune Points at the cost of Mental Health.
