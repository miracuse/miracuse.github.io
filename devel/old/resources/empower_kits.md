Players can expend one of their resource points to pull off an impressive feat using an equipped Kit with the matching tag. A few examples are listed below.

- **Fireball** (Spirit of Flame): Expend a Mana Point to create an explosion of flame in a wide area, dealing damage and igniting objects.

- **High Impact** (Smite): Expend a Fortune Point to send an enemy flying through the air with an especially forceful swing.

- **Shock Grenade** (Electromagnetic Charges): Expend a Charge Point to use this Kit as a grenade instead of a bullet, dealing damage and magnetizing objects in a wide area.

> **Note:** Prep Points can be used in place of Mana, Fortune, or Charge Points.

- **Sinkhole** (Spirit of Water + Earth): Expend a Mana Point to turn a large area of ground into quicksand.

- **Whirlwind Dance** (Whirlwind + Windcutter): Expend a Fortune Point to make an attack against every enemy around you in a wide area.

- **Quicksilver Golem** (Golem + Quicksilver Golem): Expend a Charge Point to convert a golem into a liquid metal golem, capable of fighting and changing its shape on command.
