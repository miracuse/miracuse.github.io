# Scoundrel Writeup

Scoundrels are the most flexible class. In addition to their natural speed and stealthiness, they're capable fighters and passable magicians. Their capacity to combine capabilities opens the door to unusual playstyles.


### Agility

> Offense, Defense, Mobility

The Scoundrel's attack skill is Agility. Beyond increasing their chance to hit, Agility can be used to dodge attacks, act before others, and maneuverer.

### Cunning

> Social, Resource, Stealth, Awareness

The Scoundrel's social skill is Cunning. It's used to fast-talk, deceive others, and sense the motivations of others. It's also the Skill for moving in Stealth, determining the number of Prep Points a Scoundrel has, and detecting danger.

### Prep Points

The Scoundrel's resource is **Prep Points**, calculated using their Cunning Skill. Prep Points have numerous uses intended to make the Scoundrel feel more versatile than other classes. They might be used to call in help, spoof a disguise, or change Kits at a moment's notice. 

### Techniques and Magic

Reinforcing their theme of flexibility, Scoundrels borrow tricks from other classes. They may not be as good at combat as a Soldier but they have no issues fighting on the front lines. Likewise, they aren't masters of magic like Mages, but they can get plenty of mileage from cantrips. The ability to both is a power of its own.

### Skill Point Advancement

* **Agility** will make a Scoundrel better at combat by improving their ability to deal and avoid damage. It also bolsters their reaction time and mobility.

* **Cunning** will provide additional Prep Points, making a Scoundrel more versatile. It also reinforces stealth and social abilities.

Other interesting options might include:

* **Magic** can be useful for any of the Scoundrel subclasses. All of them have at least one magic-oriented Kit that will become usable without needing Prep Points.

* **Strength** can increase a Scoundrel's Physical health, putting them on a similar standing with Soldiers for combat efficacy. 

* **Presence** for the Bard subclass, to leverage *Resiliency Arcana* for a large pool of Prep Points at the cost of Mental Health.
