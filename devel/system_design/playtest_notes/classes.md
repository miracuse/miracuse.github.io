# Classes

### Mages are Fun

> Observation

Players really enjoy the Mage class and the magic system that goes along with it. So much so, that all of the other classes are boring in comparison. Dang.

> Takeaway

_I need to bring the other classes up to the level of enjoyment of the Mage class._

> Attempted Treatments

- (Testing) Power-up other class Kits

- (Testing) Introduce the Technique system for Soldiers/Scoundrels

---

### Alchemist Is Seen As a Support Class

> Observation

The Alchemist class is seen by Players to be a support class. Players choose a Kit loadout that's intended to support other Players, particularly Mage Players. While it isn't bad to have opportunities for Players to fill a support role, I think the Players would enjoy themselves more if support was a facet of the class rather than the focus.

> Takeaway

_I need to pivot the Alchemist class towards active gameplay, as opposed to being a potion vending machine._

> Attempted Treatments

- (Testing) Combine the various healing Kits (Physical/Mental/Revive) into one Kit to avoid pressuring Players into a full support loadout.

- (Testing) Experiment with different Kits for the Alchemist

### Soldiers Need Variety

> Observation

Many of the early Soldier Kits focused on broadening their out-of-combat experience. However, during combat Players would find themselves repeating the same "I attack that guy and spend a Fortune Point to reroll" pattern every round.One of the Players mentioned that D&D Battle Master maneuvers would be a good thing to look into.

> Takeaway

_I should liven up combat for Soldiers with more options._

> Attempted Treatments

- (Dropped) The Morale subsystem, later dropped because it didn't have much appeal to the Players

- (Testing) The Technique subsystem, built to encourage creative combat behavior

### Scoundrels are Unused

> Observation

Scoundrel's are the least played class out of the ~5 sessions conducted to-date. It may be that my particular group of Players isn't interested in thief-like classes. Or perhaps the class doesn't have much appeal when compared to the others.

> Takeaway

_I should ask the Players their thoughts. I should also explore the Scoundrel as a class, try to understand how it fits in with the other classes and polish its best features._

> Attempted Treatments

- (Planned) Ask the Players their thoughts.

- (Testing) Try a few different concepts for the class. See how Players react.
