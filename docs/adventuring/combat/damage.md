# Damage

> **Tip**: By default, any successful hit on a character or enemy deals one box of damage.

Various Kits can modify attacks. [Weapons](../../classes/soldier/index.md) can add damage and effects like knockback. Certain [Alchemy Items](../../classes/alchemist/index.md) like grenades deal damage in an area-of-effect. [Magic](../../classes/mage/index.md) might ignite enemies, pin them to the ground with gravity, or change the terrain. Similarly, enemies may have abilities that do the same for their attacks.

> **GM**: Yep.
>
> **Player 2**: Can I use Strength to block the boulder with my shield?
>
> **GM**: You can try, but it's going to be a hard roll.

Most attacks can be defended against with either **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>** or **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>**. Other threats, like traps or magic, may call on other Skills. Remember: [the Skill used should make narrative sense.](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/what-do-during-play#the-silver-rule)
