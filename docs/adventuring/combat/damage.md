# Damage

In most cases, **a successful attack from a Player or an enemy will inflict one box of Physical damage**. Various Kits and spells can modify attacks. For instance:

-   Add additional Physical/Mental damage
-   Target enemies in an area-of-effect
-   Add status effects like blindness
-   Create environmental effects like setting the environment on fire.

Similarly, enemies may have abilities that do the same for their attacks.

Players are encouraged to get creative in combat encounters. Try combining different Kits to produce new results. While you can always make a basic attack, there's nothing stopping you from using your turn to recruit bystanders or taunt the guard captain.

### Defense

    GM:       There's a boulder barreling down the hallway at you.

    Player 1: Can I use Agility to dive out of the way?

    GM:       Yeap.

    Player 2: Can I use Strength to "block" the boulder with my shield?

    GM:       You can try, but it's going to be a hard roll.

| Skill      | Defense                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Strength   | Block Physical attacks, withstand harm. |
| Agility    | Dodge Physical attacks, avoid harm.     |
| Bravery    | Endure Mental attacks, overcome fear.   |
| Perception | Notice a trap before stepping on it.    |
| Cunning    | Sense danger before it strikes.         |
| Presence   | Detect evil magic in the air.           |

Most attacks can be defended against by either **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>** or **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>**. Other threats, like traps or strange magic, may call on other Skills. Remember: [the Skill used should make narrative sense.](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/what-do-during-play#the-silver-rule)
