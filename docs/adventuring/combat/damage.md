# Damage

In most cases, **a successful attack from a Player or an enemy will inflict one box of Physical damage**. This is the case regardless of whether the attack comes from a sword, arrow, fireball, or anywhere else.

However, various Kits can modify attacks. [Techniques](../../classes/soldier/index.md) can add damage and effects like knockback. [Items](../../classes/alchemist/index.md) like grenades deal damage in an area-of-effect. [Magic](../../classes/mage/index.md) might ignite enemies, pin them to the ground with gravity, or change the terrain.

Similarly, enemies may have abilities that do the same for their attacks.

### Defense

    GM:       There's a boulder barreling down the hallway at you.

    Player 1: Can I use Agility to dive out of the way?

    GM:       Yep.

    Player 2: Can I use Strength to block the boulder with my shield?

    GM:       You can try, but it's going to be a hard roll.

Most attacks can be defended against with either **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>** or **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>**. Other threats, like traps or magic, may call on other Skills. Remember: [the Skill used should make narrative sense.](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/what-do-during-play#the-silver-rule)
