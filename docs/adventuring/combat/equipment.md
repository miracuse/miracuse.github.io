# Equipment

> **GM**: The thorny brambles jab into your skin, causing Physical damage.

> **Player**: Wait. I'm wearing a full suit of metal armor.
>
> **GM**: Oh. Yeah, then you don't take any damage.

Equipment in _Miracuse_ is handled narratively. Meaning that Players don't manage individual items in an inventory, as would be the case for many other TTRPG's.

The weapons and armor that a character carries around are part of how they're described. A Soldier might march in full metal armor with a massive sword on their back. Or they might wear a cloth uniform and carry a musket. Their health, defense, and other statistics aren't affected by the choice.

That being said, choice of equipment has narrative effects. A character in metal armor isn't going to be bothered by biting insects. They will, however, have a much harder time swimming.

### Weapons and Skills

| Skill      | Common Weapons                           |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Strength   | Swords, axes, longbows, etc.             |
| Agility    | Throwing knives, garrotes, rapiers, etc. |
| Perception | Guns, crossbows, slingshots, etc.        |
| Magic      | Fire, lightning, ice, etc.               |

The Skill a character uses when attacking roughly corresponds to the weapons they use, but isn't restricted by any means. A Player might make a reasonable argument for why they use a weapon with a different Skill. So long as the GM and other players approve of the justification, there's no reason why they shouldn't be able to flavor their character's fighting style appropriately.

### Adventuring Gear

> **GM**: The pit is about 50 feet deep, and the sides look difficult to climb down.
>
> **Player 1**: Do I have any rope?
>
> **GM**: Given how you've described your character as a wizard carrying around wands and books, probably not.
>
> **Player 2**: How about me? I'm like an Indiana Jones adventurer.
>
> **GM**: Yeah, your character probably has some rope on hand. I'll have y'all roll Strength or Agility to do some mountaineering.
>
> **Player 3**: Could I use "What You Needed" to pull out a full set of climbing gear?
>
> **GM**: Okay. I'll say that with that, no one needs to roll to climb down the pit.

Many situations may call for some specific piece of gear like a coil of rope or a torch. Unless the Players have gone out of their way to acquire that gear, the GM will decide whether or not their character is likely to have it on hand.

An exception to this is the **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Alchemist's</span>** [What You Needed](../../classes/scoundrel/index.md) ability. They can spend a Charge Point to pull out equipment that their character might not normally have on hand.
