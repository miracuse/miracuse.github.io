# Combat

    Player 1: I'm going to stab the wolf.

    GM:       Alright, give me a Strength or Agility roll.

    Player 1: My guy is pretty fast, so let's go with
              Agility. That's... a +2.

    GM:       That hits. You take out the wolf, but the
              rest of its pack is still circling.

**Combat** is any situation where several characters need to take different actions and turn order matters. The most common scenario involves fighting, but other possibilities might include fixing a sinking ship or racing a rival adventuring party for treasure.

-   Roll **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>** to determine the order that characters will act.

-   On their turn, characters can take one action (usually a single roll of the dice).

### Actions

In general, a player's turn ends after they roll dice or do something. For example:

-   Swinging a sword

-   Drinking an elixir

-   Casting a spell

-   Intimidating an enemy

Actions and turn order rules aren't set in stone. There are plenty of things that won't take up an entire action, like saying a few words to another person. There are also times when it makes sense for a character to react outside of their turn, like stepping into oncoming fire to protect an ally. Ultimately, a **player's turn begins and ends when it makes narrative sense**. The GM will provide guidance as necessary.

### Offense and Defense

Just like any other situation in the game, combat works through Skill use. If you want to swing a sword, you need to roll a Skill that makes sense (usually **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>** or **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>**). Some general guidelines are provided here but remember that narrative sense is more important than specific rules.

| Action                      | Skill      |
| --------------------------- | ---------- |
| Swinging a sword forcefully | Strength   |
| Swinging a sword gracefully | Agility    |
| Shooting a bow precisely    | Perception |
| Shooting a bow swiftly      | Agility    |
| Throwing a fireball         | Magic      |
| Blocking an arrow           | Strength   |
| Dodging an arrow            | Agility    |
