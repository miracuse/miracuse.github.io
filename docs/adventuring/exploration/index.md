# Exploration

    Player: I want to climb the cliffside.

    GM: Okay. Roll Agility.

    Player: I have a 0 in Agility and rolled a -1. That's a total of -1.

    GM: That's not good. You get to the top, but it took a lot out of you.
    Mark a box of Physical damage from exhaustion.

**Exploration** plays a large part in most adventures. Players will undoubtedly
find themselves faced with hazards and obstacles that require careful planning
to overcome. 

### Making Camp

**Making Camp** allows characters to recover and lets Players change their equipped Kits. It can be done anytime the characters are somewhere safe and comfortable enough to rest.

- **Recovering Health and Injuries** requires eight hours of rest.

- **Changing Kits** requires one hour of rest. During this time, resources like Fortune Points, Prep Points, and Alchemist Kit uses are recovered.

>**Note**: In dangerous areas, Players might want to set a watch to avoid getting ambushed. Any Player that takes a shift should roll **<span style="color: #268bd2">Perception</span>**.

### Scouting

To **Scout** ahead, a Player rolls **<span style="color: #90a959">Cunning</span>**. Their character [quietly moves forward](stealth.md), collects information about the area, then returns to their party. A successful scouting mission can identify traps and ambushes, while failed scouting missions can result in triggering traps or alerting enemies.

>**Note**: Scouting missions usually take place over one action. Longer scouting missions are possible, but not recommended. [Splitting the Party](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSplitTheParty) doesn't usually end well after all.
