# Exploration

> **Player**: I want to climb the cliffside.
>
> **GM**: Okay. Roll Agility.
>
> **Player**: I have a 0 in Agility and rolled a -1. That's a total of -1.
>
> **GM**: That's not good. You get to the top, but it took a lot out of you. Mark a box of Physical damage from exhaustion.

**Exploration** plays a large part in most adventures. Players will undoubtedly find themselves faced with threats from the environment, and will need to find ways to avoid harm.

### Hazards

[Hazards](../../gm_pages/making_hazards.html) are threats that can't be resolved through combat. Examples might include:

* Arrow traps in ancient ruins

* Arctic cold that gradually causes frostbite

* Lingering curses in a desecrated shrine room

* An avalanche rushing down a mountain

* An indestructible golem standing watch over a tomb

##### Solving Hazards

Hazards often require Skill rolls to overcome. An arrow trap, for example, might be noticed with a **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Perception</span>** roll, dodged with an **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>** roll, and disabled with a **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>** roll.

Other solutions could involve the use of kits and resources. A trapped door might be opened with a grenade, or triggered with a ten-foot pole.
