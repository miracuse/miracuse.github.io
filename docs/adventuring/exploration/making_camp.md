# Making Camp

> **Player**: Alright, I think we're pretty beat up. Let's set camp.
>
> **GM**: You're in the middle of a cursed forest with a lot of nasty critters prowling.
>
> **Player**: Oh. Yeah. Can I use _Talisman of Abjuration_ to set a ward?
>
> **GM**: Roll Magic for it.

**Making Camp** allows characters to recover and lets Players change their equipped Kits. It can be done anytime the characters are somewhere safe and comfortable enough to rest. A full recovery requires roughly eight hours of rest.
