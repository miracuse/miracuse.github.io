# Stealth

> **Player**: I want to blend in with the crowd. Look inconspicuous.
>
> **GM**: Alright. You're in Stealth.
>
> **Player**: Great. Now I want to sneak up behind the merchant and steal his purse.
>
> **GM**: Roll Cunning to keep anyone from noticing.

Characters with points in the **<span style="color: #90a959">Cunning</span>** Skill are able to move and act without attracting notice.

In most cases, a Player can simply declare that they're in **Stealth**. Dice rolls are only required when there might be some reason for onlookers to pay attention. For example, if the character is being chased, or if they're trying to pick someone's pocket.

### When to Roll

| Don't Roll                                                           | Do Roll                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Sneaking past disinterested villagers                                | Sneaking past on-duty guards             |
| [Disguising](../../classes/scoundrel/index.md) yourself as a cultist | Lying to the cult leader while disguised |
| Blending in with a crowd                                             | Hiding from hot pursuit                  |

### Sneak Attacks

A character that attacks while in Stealth does not need to roll. Their attack receives an automatic +2, as though they had rolled a 10. However, the act of making a **Sneak Attack** usually breaks stealth and alerts others to your presence.

### Scouting

To **Scout** ahead, a Player rolls **<span style="color: #90a959">Cunning</span>**. Their character [quietly moves forward](stealth.md), collects information about the area, then returns to their party. A successful scouting mission can identify traps and ambushes, while failed scouting missions can result in triggering traps or alerting enemies.

> **Note**: Scouting missions usually take place over one action. Longer scouting missions are possible, but not recommended. [Splitting the Party](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSplitTheParty) doesn't usually end well after all.
