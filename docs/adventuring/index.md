# Adventuring

Most of the game involves Players using [Skills](../gameplay/skills.md) and [Kits](../gameplay/kits.md) to move the narrative forward. But there are some situations, like combat, that have additional rules to keep the game rolling smoothly.

- [**Combat Challenges**](combat/index.md) involve activities like skirmishing with goblins, fighting a giant, or racing against another party of adventurers.

- [**Exploration Challenges**](exploration/index.md) involve activities like searching for hidden treasure, sneaking through the wilderness, or making camp for the night.

- [**Social Challenges**](social/index.md) involve activities like convincing a guard to let you pass, threatening a group of bandits, or petitioning nature spirits for aid.
