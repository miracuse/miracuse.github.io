# Social

    Player: Can I haggle a discount from the merchant?

    GM: Sure. Roll Cunning.

    Player: Uh... how about Bravery? I have points in that.

    GM: If you want to use Bravery, you'll need to take a different
    approach. You can intimidate, impress, or provoke them.

    Player: Hm. I'll try to impress them. I'm a well-known mercenary,
    so maybe I can convince him that other people will shop here if
    they know I do?

    GM: It'll be a hard roll, but go ahead.

**Social** encounters rely on the ability of Players to negotiate with the GM's fictional characters.

### Persuasion

| Skill     | Good For...                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bravery   | Inspiring, intimidating, provoking                        |
| Knowledge | Rhetorical discussion, legal disputes, educated audiences |
| Magic     | Petitioning spirits, communing with forces of nature      |
| Cunning   | Bluffing, fast-talk, animal handling                      |

Each of the classes has their own approach to persuasion. Some approaches work better or worse depending on the audience. A **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Soldier</span>** might threaten a bandit king into submission, but they probably won't succeed in intimidating an actual king.

> **Note**: Players shouldn't persuade other Players using Skill rolls, unless both want to.

### Sense Motive

    Player 1: Does it seem like this farmer is lying to us about the wolves?

    GM: Roll Cunning, or Perception.

    Player 1: What does a +1 get me?

    GM: There's something off here, but you don't know what.

Players might find themselves questioning the sincerity of shady merchants or suspicious witches. If they feel like an NPC is hiding something, they can use a Skill like **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>** or **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Perception</span>** to deduce more information.
