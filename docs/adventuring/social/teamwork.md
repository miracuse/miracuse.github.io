# Teamwork

    Player 1: I want to bend the metal bars on the
              prison door open.

    GM:       Okay, roll Strength.

    Player 2: Wait. Can I help them?

    GM:       Do you have any points in Strength?

    Player 2: No...

    Player 3: I do.

    GM:       Alright, Player 3 can help. Player 1,
              roll with Advantage.

**Teamwork** lets one character help another with a task, provided they both have points in the required Skill and that the method of aid makes narrative sense.
