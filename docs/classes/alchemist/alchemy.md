# Alchemy

> **Player**: I want to take down the wall with a _Concussive Charge_.
>
> **GM**: Alright. You can mark off a potion to produce a grenade.

Alchemy kits are some of the most versatile in _Miracuse_. They include strange substances, poisons, explosives, and semi-magical tools. This section provides a few examples of how alchemy kits are used.

### Using Alchemy

{% include example_kit_param.html content="Concussive Charges" %}

Unlike [magic](../mage/magic.html), alchemy isn't tied to a specific skill. The _Concussive Charges_ kit will generally use **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Perception</span>** because it corresponds to shooting a gun. Certain poisons might be used with **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>** if they're being discretely slipped into someone's drink, or **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>** if they've been applied to a throwing knife. **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>** is often used for unconventional applications of an alchemy kit.

Many alchemy kits can be amplified by **expending a Potion Box**. The exact effect will vary depending on the kit used and the Player's intention. A common effect is to turn the kit into a grenade that creates a much larger area of effect.

### Potions

> **Tip**: Using a potion in combat takes an action.

The primary use of potions is to recover from Physical damage or remove afflictions like poison. Unlike many alchemy items, they can be used by anyone regardless of training. 

The secondary use of potions is to empower alchemy kits. Many tools can be converted into grenades or otherwise enhanced by using a potion.

##### Flashback Handoffs

As part of using a potion, an Alchemist can declare that they gave the potion to another player characters earlier in the day, so long as they could have plausibly done so. -->
