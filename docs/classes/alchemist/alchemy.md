# Alchemy

> **Player**: I want to take down the wall with a _Concussive Charge_.
>
> **GM**: Alright. You can mark off a potion to produce a grenade.

Alchemy kits are some of the most versatile in _Miracuse_. They include strange substances, poisons, explosives, and semi-magical tools. This section provides a few examples of how alchemy kits are used.

### Potions

> **Tip**: Using a potion in combat takes an action.

The primary use of potions is to recover from Physical damage or remove afflictions like poison. Unlike many alchemy items, they can be used by anyone regardless of training. 

The secondary use of potions is to empower alchemy kits. Many tools can be converted into grenades or otherwise enhanced by using a potion.

##### Flashback Handoffs

As part of using a potion, an Alchemist can declare that they gave the potion to another player characters earlier in the day, so long as they could have plausibly done so.

### Other Notes

##### Skill Use

Unlike Talismans, alchemy kits are not generally tied to a specific skill. A kit like the Bard's _Faerie Fire_ might be used with Cunning to perform, Agility to cause harm, or with no skill at all for simple tasks like creating smokescreens.

##### Kits Without Direct Uses

Not all Alchemy kits have direct uses. The _Golem_ kit, for example, provides a rock golem servant that follows orders.
