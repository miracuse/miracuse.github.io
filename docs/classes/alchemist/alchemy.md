# Alchemy

> **Player**: I want to take down the wall with a grenade.
>
> **GM**: Alright. The grenade goes off, making a loud explosion and blowing a hole in the wall. Mark off a Charge Point.

Alchemy kits are some of the most versatile in _Miracuse_. They include strange substances, poisons, explosives, and semi-magical tools. This section provides a few examples of how alchemy kits are used.

### Potions

> **Tip**: Using a potion in combat takes an action.

Charge Points can be spent to _Produce a Potion_, allowing someone to recover two Physical boxes. Unlike most alchemy kits, potions can be used by non-Alchemists without issue.

##### Flashback Handoffs

As part of _Produce a Potion_, an Alchemist can declare that they gave a potion to one of the other player characters earlier in the day, so long as they could have plausibly done so.

---

### Grenades

> **Tip**: Grenades can harm allies too. Be careful when throwing them into the fray.

Charge Points can also be spent to _Produce a Grenade_, which cause damage in a wide area of effect and impact surroundings. Certain kits can change the effect of grenades.

### Other Notes

##### Skill Use

Unlike Talismans, alchemy kits are not generally tied to a specific skill. A kit like the Bard's _Faerie Fire_ might be used with Cunning to perform, Agility to cause harm, or with no skill at all for simple tasks like creating smokescreens.

##### Kits Without Direct Uses

Not all Alchemy kits have direct uses. The _Golem_ kit, for example, provides a rock golem servant that follows orders.
