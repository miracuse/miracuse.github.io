# Charge Points

{% include alchemy_uses.html %}

The Alchemist's resource is Charge Points. In addition to the [usual applications](../../gameplay/resources.md), Charge Points can be spent to:

- **Produce a Potion** that can restore Physical boxes, treat poisons, or heal similar afflictions.

- **Produce a Grenade** that can deal Physical damage in an area-of-effect and destroy objects.

- Declare that you have "**What You Needed**", describing an item that can help you with the problem at hand, such as a bribe or a tool.

### Potions

Alchemists don't need to worry about handing out potions to other Players in the middle of combat. So long as it makes sense, they can declare that they handed out a potion earlier in the day. When consumed in combat, drinking a potion takes a turn.

> **Note:** Potions are the only Alchemy items that other classes can safely use without rolling **Knowledge**. Non-Alchemist Players can roll to try to use others, though failure can cause disastrous results.
