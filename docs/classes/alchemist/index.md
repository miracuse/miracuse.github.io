# Alchemist

- **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Perception</span>**: Alchemists use [Perception](../../more/skills/perception.html) to aim guns, detect danger, and investigate for more information.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>**: Alchemists use [Knowledge](../../more/skills/knowledge.html) to produce potions, persuade others, and learn about the world.

### Potions

**Potions** are a valuable resource, both as a tool for recovering from harm and as an item to be bartered. **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledgeable</span>** adventurers have access to more potions than others.

- **Heal**: Drinking a potion can instantly recover two Physical boxes or treat a natural affliction (poison, disease, etc.)

- **Perform Synthesis**: Empower an Alchemy kit to go beyond its usual usage for a single action.

### Knowledge

> **Tip**: The most common uses of Knowledge are **asking questions about the world** and **rhetoric**.

The Alchemist's social skill focuses on exploration and logical arguments. **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>** is used when a player has a question about the world. "What kind of disease is this person suffering from?" "What do I know about this captain's reputation?"

It's also used when persuading others with reason. Convincing a bandit that you aren't worth robbing because the risk doesn't outweigh the reward falls under this category.
