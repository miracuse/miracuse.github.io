# Alchemist

The Alchemist is a keen adventurer, keeping a watchful eye out for danger and a finger on the trigger. They carry a collection of handy items to throw at any problem that arises.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Perception</span>**: Alchemists are good at detecting danger, finding clues, and searching for hidden treasure. They also use this skill to make precise attacks with ranged weapons.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>**: Alchemists are familiar with many different fields that might be useful to an adventurer, such as monster biology or regional politics. This Skill also determines how many uses of their Kits they have, and their ability to persuade others using rhetoric.

- **[Charge Points](#charge-points)**: The Alchemist's resource allows them to produce potions, create grenades, and improvise items to save the day. They can also use it to pull off a fantastical display of alchemy by amplifying one of their Kits.

### Alchemy

Alchemy is a scientific discipline. The conventional process for becoming an Alchemist is to study under a master, developing careful discernment and committing formulae to memory over an apprenticeship. Students graduate as full-fledged journeymen when they prove their ability "to heal and to harm" by brewing a potion and fabricating a grenade. Such recipes are only taught when a student is believed to be ready to handle the responsibility of both.

Journeyman are encouraged to develop their skills through travel. They ply their trade in cities, battlefields, ancient ruins, and elsewhere. Their skill in creating miraculous healing draughts makes them welcome in many communities, though finding true companions is rare. An Alchemist's formal education and foreign worldview make it difficult to fit amongst locals. 

While often compared to **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**, the products of Alchemy are distinctly more consistent. A Mage's power depends on their relationship with spirits. Their spells are never quite the same across any two castings. In contrast, an Alchemist's workings are more reliable. Their grenades do not misfire, their potions are never duds, and any particular workings they've come up with are predictable in their effects.

### Charge Points

Alchemists keep a small stash of potent reagents, capable of greatly empowering alchemy. These are represented as **Charge Points** and can be used for the following:

* **Amplify an Alchemy Kit**: Empower an equipped alchemy kit to go far beyond its usual usage.

* **Produce a Potion**: Create a drinkable panacea that can instantly recover two Physical boxes or treat a natural affliction (poison, disease, etc.)

* **Produce a Grenade**: Create an explosive that can harm others in an area-of-effect and destroy obstacles.

* **What You Needed**: Declare that you just so happen to have an item that can help with the present situation, like climbing gear or a collapsible 10 foot pole.

### Specializations

### <span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">The Chemist</span>

Every Alchemist can brew potions and craft grenades, but a Chemist goes beyond proficiency into mastery. Their emphasis on the fundamentals results in higher grade products with superb potency. Chemists are commonly recruited as Court Alchemists, researchers, and physicians by influential organizations.

### <span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">The Enchanter</span>

Esoteric philosophers seeking to unify alchemy and magic by creating life. Enchanters have succeeded in engineering a variety of constructs to serve their needs. Though coveted by ambitious nations, many Enchanters are held in low esteem by other Alchemists, and are generally considered heretical by Mages.

### <span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">The Sapper</span>

Military Alchemists that specialize in munitions. Sappers have played a large part in checking the traditional role of Mages on the battlefield in recent years. Their elemental grenades and sharpshooting skills have changed the shape of warfare.
