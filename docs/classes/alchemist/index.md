# Alchemist

The Alchemist is a keen adventurer, keeping a watchful eye out for danger and a finger on the trigger. They carry a collection of handy items to throw at any problem that arises.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Perception</span>**: Alchemists are good at detecting danger, finding clues, and searching for hidden treasure. They also use this skill to make precise attacks with ranged weapons.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>**: Alchemists are familiar with many different fields that might be useful to an adventurer, such as monster biology or regional politics. This Skill also determines how many uses of their Kits they have, and their ability to persuade others using rhetoric.

### Alchemy

Kits with the _Alchemy_ tag include powerful items and tools. A few examples include:

- **Special Bullets** that create effects like fire and ice on impact.

- **Construct Servants** like golems and flying carpets.

- **Formula Circles** that can be used to reshape raw materials into handy objects.
