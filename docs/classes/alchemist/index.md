# Alchemist

The Alchemist is a keen adventurer, keeping a watchful eye out for danger and a finger on the trigger. They carry a collection of handy items to throw at any problem that arises.

-   **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Perception</span>**: Alchemists are good at detecting danger, finding clues, and searching for hidden treasure. They also use this Skill to attack with ranged weapons (crossbows, guns, etc.)

-   **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>**: Alchemists are familiar with many different fields that might be useful to an adventurer, such as monster biology or regional politics. This Skill also determines how many uses of their Kits they have, and their ability to persuade others using rhetoric.

### Charges

Alchemist Kit's are powerful, but have a limited number of **Charges** based on the character's **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>**. Alchemists mark a box each time they use one of their Kits, and recover all of their Charges when they make camp.

### Items

{% include single_alchemist_kit.html %}

An Alchemist Kit can take various forms:

-   **Potions** are consumable liquids that provide beneficial effects.
-   **Substances** are versatile compounds that can produce a variety of effects in the hands of an Alchemist.
-   **Grenades** are dangerous explosives that may inflict damage or cause hazards in an area-of-effect.
-   **Bullets** are modified projectiles with additional effects.
-   **Tools** are Alchemy Kits that don't fall under one of the other categories.

> **Note:** Potions are the only Alchemy Kits that other classes can safely use. Non-Alchemist Players can roll Knowledge to try to use the other categories, though failure can cause disastrous results.

Additional information about Items can be found on [this page](../../more_resources/alchemy/index.md).
