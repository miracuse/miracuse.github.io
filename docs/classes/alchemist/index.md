# Alchemist

The Alchemist is a keen adventurer, keeping a watchful eye out for danger and a finger on the trigger. They carry a collection of handy items to throw at any problem that arises.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Perception</span>**: Alchemists are good at detecting danger, finding clues, and searching for hidden treasure. They also use this skill to make precise attacks with ranged weapons.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>**: Alchemists are familiar with many different fields that might be useful to an adventurer, such as monster biology or regional politics. This Skill also influences their ability to persuade others using rhetoric.

- **[Potions](#potions)**: Alchemists keep a stash of potions on hand, able to miraculously heal wounds or fuel powerful alchemy.

### Potions

**Potions** are a valuable resource, both as a tool for recovering from harm and as an item to be bartered. **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledgeable</span>** adventurers have access to more potions than others.

- **Heal**: Drinking a potion can instantly recover two Physical boxes or treat a natural affliction (poison, disease, etc.)

- **Perform Synthesis**: Empower an Alchemy kit to go beyond its usual usage for a single action.

### Knowledge

> **Tip**: The most common uses of Knowledge are **asking questions about the world** and **rhetoric**.

The Alchemist's social skill focuses on exploration and logical arguments. **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>** is used when a player has a question about the world. "What kind of disease is this person suffering from?" "What do I know about this captain's reputation?"

It's also used when persuading others with reason. Convincing a bandit that you aren't worth robbing because the risk doesn't outweigh the reward falls under this category.
