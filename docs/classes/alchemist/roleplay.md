### Place in Society

Alchemists in _Miracuse_ are a recent historical development. Their arrival is synonymous with an unsettling of ancient regimes, disrupting feudalistic societies through the introduction of non-magical weaponry, healing, and education. The nations of the world have been divided in their response. Though many would like to scour alchemy off the face of the world, none can afford to turn down the advantages that alchemy provides.

Example Concepts:

- A field researcher compiling notes for their next publication

- A mercenary gunslinger offering their services to the highest bidder

- The second son of noble family tasked with making his own inheritance

### Knowledge

> **Tip**: The most common uses of Knowledge are **asking questions about the world** and **rhetoric**.

The Alchemist's social skill focuses on exploration and logical arguments. **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>** is used when a player has a question about the world. "What kind of disease is this person suffering from?" "What do I know about this general's reputation?"

It's also used when persuading others with reason. Convincing a bandit that you aren't worth robbing because the risk doesn't outweigh the reward falls under this category.

### Trade Secrets

> **Tip**: The Alchemist's Guild is a highly-influential group, though its role in society is ambiguous. GM's might vary their level of involvement depending on the kind of adventure being run.

Many organizations are interested in controlling the secrets of alchemy. Ambitious kings see the potential of an army outfitted with firearms, and greedy merchants would love nothing more than to see miraculous potions at a premium. Alchemists are tasked with protecting the secrets of their art from those who would misuse them. Only masters designated by the guild are allowed to pass the art on. Alchemists that violate that trust find themselves hunted by well-paid bounty hunters.

**_Socially..._**
