### Alchemy

Alchemy is a scientific discipline. The conventional process for becoming an Alchemist is to study under a master, developing careful discernment and committing formulae to memory over an apprenticeship. Journeyman are encouraged to develop their skills while traveling across the world. They ply their trade in cities, battlefields, ancient ruins, and elsewhere. Their skill in creating miraculous healing draughts makes them welcome in many communities, though finding true companions is rare. An Alchemist's foreign worldview make it difficult to fit amongst locals.

While often compared to **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**, the products of Alchemy are distinctly more consistent. A Mage's power depends on their relationship with spirits. Their spells are never quite the same across any two castings. In contrast, an Alchemist's workings are more reliable. Their grenades do not misfire, their potions are never duds, and any particular workings they've come up with are predictable in their effects.

### Place in Society

Alchemists in _Miracuse_ are a recent historical development. Their arrival is synonymous with an unsettling of ancient regimes, disrupting feudalistic societies through the introduction of non-magical weaponry, healing, and education. The nations of the world have been divided in their response. Though many would like to scour alchemy off the face of the world, none can afford to turn down the advantages that alchemy provides.

Example Concepts:

- A field researcher compiling notes for their next publication

- A mercenary gunslinger offering their services to the highest bidder

- The second son of noble family tasked with making his own inheritance

### What is a Potion?

> **Tip**: Alchemists aren't the only ones with the know-how to brew potions. Many adventurers and medical practitioners have picked up enough chemistry to cook small batches.

Potions come in a great many varieties and recipes, but nearly all share a base ingredient of Pyre Powder. 

Pyre Powder is a processed material whose manufacture is a carefully kept trade secret of the Alchemist Guild. When dissolved in a mixture of oils and mineral water, it produces a highly reactive chemical that accelerates natural healing mechanisms. Unfortunately, the resulting mixture only retains its potency for a day.

Many Alchemists have found Pyre Powder mixtures to be useful in enhancing other alchemical products. Grenades, created by mixing potions with gunpowder and other substances, are a common application.

### Roles

##### In combat...

The Alchemist keeps their distance, taking shots at range with firearms using **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Perception</span>**. They're able to treat injuries with potions, and are capable of repelling large groups of enemies with grenades. Their lack of **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>** or **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>** leaves them vulnerable in close combat.

##### Socially...

The Alchemist specializes in debate using **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>**. Their rhetorical technique is well-received by the wealthy and educated, but not as effective on less affluent listeners.

##### While exploring...

The Alchemist makes for an excellent lookout. Their sharp senses and wealth of lore will keep the party informed of approaching dangers well before arrival. Their kits are similarly well-suited to solving [Hazards](../../adventuring/exploration/index.html#hazards).
