### Alchemy

Alchemy is a scientific discipline. The conventional process for becoming an Alchemist is to study under a master, developing careful discernment and committing formulae to memory over an apprenticeship. Students graduate as full-fledged journeymen when they prove their ability "to heal and to harm" by brewing a potion and fabricating a grenade. Such recipes are only taught when a student is believed to be ready to handle the responsibility of both.

Journeyman are encouraged to develop their skills through travel. They ply their trade in cities, battlefields, ancient ruins, and elsewhere. Their skill in creating miraculous healing draughts makes them welcome in many communities, though finding true companions is rare. An Alchemist's foreign worldview make it difficult to fit amongst locals.

While often compared to **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**, the products of Alchemy are distinctly more consistent. A Mage's power depends on their relationship with spirits. Their spells are never quite the same across any two castings. In contrast, an Alchemist's workings are more reliable. Their grenades do not misfire, their potions are never duds, and any particular workings they've come up with are predictable in their effects.

### Place in Society

Alchemists in _Miracuse_ are a recent historical development. Their arrival is synonymous with an unsettling of ancient regimes, disrupting feudalistic societies through the introduction of non-magical weaponry, healing, and education. The nations of the world have been divided in their response. Though many would like to scour alchemy off the face of the world, none can afford to turn down the advantages that alchemy provides.

Example Concepts:

- A field researcher compiling notes for their next publication

- A mercenary gunslinger offering their services to the highest bidder

- The second son of noble family tasked with making his own inheritance

### Trade Secrets

> **Tip**: The Alchemist's Guild is a highly-influential group, though its role in society is ambiguous. GM's might vary their level of involvement depending on the kind of adventure being run.

Many organizations are interested in controlling the secrets of alchemy. Ambitious kings see the potential of an army outfitted with firearms, and greedy merchants would love nothing more than to see miraculous potions at a premium. Alchemists are tasked with protecting the secrets of their art from those who would misuse them. Only masters designated by the guild are allowed to pass the art on. Alchemists that violate that trust find themselves hunted by well-paid bounty hunters.

### Roles

##### In combat...

The Alchemist keeps their distance, taking shots at range with firearms using **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Perception</span>**. They're able to repel large waves of enemies with _Grenades_, and treat injuries with _Potions_. Their lack of **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>** or **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>** leaves them vulnerable in close combat.

##### Socially...

The Alchemist specializes in debate using **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>**. Their rhetorical technique is well-received by the wealthy and educated, but not as effective on less affluent listeners. 

##### While exploring...

The Alchemist makes for an excellent lookout. Their sharp senses and wealth of lore will keep the party informed of approaching dangers well before arrival. Their kits are similarly well-suited to solving [Hazards](../../adventuring/exploration/index.html#hazards).
