# Specializations

**Specializations** determine which [Kits](kits.md) a player can use. New characters start with one subclass, gaining more the longer they adventure.

An Alchemist that dabbles in magic, using their abilities to create servants and magical tools.

### <span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">The Sapper</span>

An Alchemist that specializes in firearms and explosives. The Sapper focuses their energies exclusively on destructive compounds. They use synthesized bullets and grenades to wreak havoc on the battlefield.

### <span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">The Transmuter</span>

An Alchemist that changes the world around them. The Transmuter reshapes objects they touch, both physically and chemically.
