# Custom Class

The base classes can be used for many character concepts, but players may also choose to make a **Custom Class**.

Custom Classes allow players to change their starting Skills to better reflect an idea. For example, a **<span style="color: {{ site.paladin_color }}">Paladin</span>** might mix a **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Soldier's</span>** Skills with a **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Mage's</span>** Kits to create a character that can use magic and fight with weapons.

### Creating a Custom Class

-   Choose one of the following Skill spreads.

    -   Standard (Two Skills at +2)
    -   Versatile (One Skill at +2, Two Skills at +1)

-   Choose one Subclass, chosen from any of the base classes.

### Example: **<span style="color: {{ site.paladin_color }}">The Paladin</span>**

**Subclass**

-   **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Mage</span>**/Priest

**Skills**

-   **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>** +2
-   **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Bravery</span>** +1
-   **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** +1

**Description**

A holy knight trained in the arts of war and magic. **<span style="color: {{ site.paladin_color }}">Paladins</span>** aren't well-suited to spellcasting, but gain a great deal of versatility from their access to **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Mage</span>** Kits. Likewise, **<span style="color: {{ site.paladin_color }}">Paladins</span>** have none of the Techniques of a **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Soldier</span>**, but have similar durability and **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>**.
