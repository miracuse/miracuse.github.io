# Custom Classes

The base classes can be used for many character concepts, but players may also choose to make a **Custom Class**.

Custom Classes allow players to change their starting Skills to better reflect a specific character idea. For example, a **<span style="color: {{ site.paladin_color }}">Paladin</span>** might mix a **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Soldier's</span>** Skills with a **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Mage's</span>** Kits to create a character that can use magic and fight with weapons.

### Creating a Custom Class

- Choose one specialization, taken from any of the base classes.

- Choose one of the following Skill spreads.

  - Standard (Two Skills at +2)
  - Versatile (One Skill at +2, Two Skills at +1)

### Example: **<span style="color: {{ site.paladin_color }}">The Paladin</span>**

**Specialization**

- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Mage</span>**/Priest

**Skills**

- **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>** +2
- **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Bravery</span>** +1
- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** +1

**Description**

A holy knight trained in the arts of war and magic. **<span style="color: {{ site.paladin_color }}">Paladins</span>** don't have the Mental Health to cast many spells, but gain a great deal of versatility from their access to **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Mage</span>** Kits. Likewise, **<span style="color: {{ site.paladin_color }}">Paladins</span>** have none of the _Techniques_ of a **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Soldier</span>**, but have similar durability and **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>**.
