# Custom Class

The base classes can be used for many character concepts, but players may also choose to make a **Custom Class**.

Custom Classes allow players to change their starting Skills to better reflect an idea. For example, a Paladin might mix a Soldier's Skills with a Mage's Kits to create a character that can use magic and fight with weapons.

### Creating a Custom Class

-   Choose one of the following Skill spreads

    -   Standard (Two Skills at +2)
    -   Versatile (One Skill at +2, Two Skills at +1)

-   Choose one Subclass, chosen from any of the base classes

### Example: The Paladin

**Subclass**

-   Mage/Priest

**Skills**

-   Strength +2
-   Bravery +1
-   Magic +1

**Description**

A holy knight trained in the arts of war and magic. Paladins
aren't well-suited to spellcasting, but gain a great deal of
versatility from their access to Priest Kits. Likewise, Paladins
have none of the techniques of a Soldier, but have similar
durability and Strength.
