# The Mage

The Mage forms pacts with the primal spirits of the world to perform miracles and spells. Some come by their magic through careful study, others through natural aptitude or religious tradition.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**: Mages use Talismans to channel otherworldly power. They roll this Skill whenever they do so.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>**: Mages have a sixth sense for magic. They can feel it in the air and identify its purpose when focusing. They're also able to manipulate ambient magic to bewitch others. 

- **[Mana](#mana)**: Mages have pools of energy within them that can be used to empower Talismans for powerful magic.

### Mana

Adventurers with a strong relationship to the supernatural accumulate power inside their bodies, called **Mana**, which can be used in the casting of spells. One of the signs of having Mana is an abnormally strong **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>**.

- **Perform High Magic**: Empower an equipped Talisman to go beyond its usual capabilities for a single use.

- **Perform Complex Magic**: Combine two Talismans to produce a more complex effect for a single use.

### Presence

> **Tip:** The most common uses of Presence are to **identify magical forces at play** and **bend others to your will**.

The Mage's social skill allows them to sense supernatural disturbances and charm others into doing their bidding. **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>** is used when a player wants to understand magical elements in an area. "Does the magic in this place feel evil?" "Can I tell what the spell on that door does?"

It's also used to influence the minds of others. A Mage can muddle the mind of a disinterested guard, "These are not the adventurers you're looking for". They can make themselves appear more attractive to the eyes of a merchant, or create an unnerving sense of dread to make animals anxious.

However, their influence is intended to be subtle rather than overt. Those who realize they're being charmed can break away with ease, and are often furious at having been manipulated. Many jurisdictions consider the exercise of **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>** to be a form of assault.
