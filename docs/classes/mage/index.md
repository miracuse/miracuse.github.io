# The Mage

The Mage forms pacts with the primal spirits of the world to perform miracles and spells. Some come by their magic through careful study, others through natural aptitude or religious tradition.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**: Mages can commune with spirits. They use this Skill whenever they use magic.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Focus</span>**: Mages have deep reserves of inner strength. This Skill increases their Mental [Health](../../gameplay/health.md), which can let them cast big spells when they're [out of resources](../../gameplay/resources#pushing-it). Focus can also be used to detect and understand magic in the area.

### Spirits

Kits with the _Spirit_ tag can be used to create magical effects using the **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** Skill. For example, a player might use the _Spirit of Flame_ Kit to:

- Throw fire at enemies.
- Make light to help see while exploring in the dark.
- Keep warm during a snowstorm.

### Mana

Mages have a number of Mana Points equal to two times their **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>**. Mana Points can be used to:

- **Summon** a minor magical servant to do your bidding, such as a pixie or an imp.

- **Empower** Kits with the _Spirit_ tag.

### Empower Spirits

Mages can create potent magical effects by amplifying or combining _Spirit_ Kits. Doing so costs a Mana Point.
