# The Mage

The Mage forms pacts with the primal spirits of the world to perform miracles and spells. Some come by their magic through careful study, others through natural aptitude or religious tradition.

-   **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**: Mages can commune with spirits. They use this Skill whenever they use magic.

-   **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Focus</span>**: Mages have deep reserves of inner strength. This Skill determines how much Mental health they have, which in turn determines how many spells they can cast without injuring themselves. Focus can also be used to detect and understand magic in the area.

### Magic

The simplest form of magic is a **Cantrip**. A Mage chooses a Kit with the "Spirit" tag, describes something they want to do, and rolls **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**. For example, a player might use the _Spirit of Flame_ Kit to:

-   Throw fire at enemies.
-   Make light to help see while exploring in the dark.
-   Keep warm during a snowstorm.

### Spells

Mages can also create larger effects by combining two Kits with the "Spirit" tag. Doing so produces more powerful and complex results, but forces the Mage to mark a point of Mental damage on themselves.
