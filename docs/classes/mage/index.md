# The Mage

The Mage forms pacts with the primal spirits of the world to perform miracles and spells. Some come by their magic through careful study, others through natural aptitude or religious tradition.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**: Mages can commune with spirits. They use this Skill whenever they use magic.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>**: Mages have deep reserves of inner strength. This Skill increases their Mental [Health](../../gameplay/health.md), which can let them cast big spells when they're [out of resources](../../gameplay/resources#pushing-it). Presence can also be used to detect and understand magic in the area.

### Spirits

Kits with the _Spirit_ tag can be used to create magical effects using the **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** Skill. For example, a player might use the _Spirit of Flame_ Kit to:

- **Throw Fire** at enemies.

- **Make Light** to help see while exploring in the dark.

- **Keep Warm** during a snowstorm or icy cavern.
