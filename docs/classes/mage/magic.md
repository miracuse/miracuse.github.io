# Magic

> **Player**: I want to throw a big exploding fireball into the middle of the bad guys.
>
> **GM**: That's a bigger spell than you can usually pull off with _Talisman of Fire_. I'll say you either have to get a +3 or spend a Mana box.

It can be difficult for new players and GM's to get a feel for the baseline power of magic in _Miracuse_. This section provides a few examples and guidelines.

### Using Magic

{% include example_kit_param.html content="Talisman of Fire" %}

By itself, the **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** skill has no effect. It can only be used in conjunction with an equipped Talisman kit.

A Mage with a _Talisman of Fire_ can roll **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** to use fire. They might use one of the examples in the kit description (floating torches, throwing fire). Or they might try more complicated actions, like creating a wall of fire.

Larger and more complex effects require higher rolls. Mages can also **expend a Mana box** to accomplish effects that would otherwise be outside of their skill level.
