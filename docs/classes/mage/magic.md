# Magic

> **Player**: I want to throw a big exploding fireball into the middle of the bad guys.
>
> **GM**: That's a bigger spell than you can usually pull off with _Talisman of Fire_. I'll say you either have to get a +3 or spend a Mana box.

It can be difficult for new players and GM's to get a feel for the baseline power of magic in _Miracuse_. This section provides a few examples to offer some context.

### Kit Usage Examples

> **Tip**: Mana boxes can be spent to enhance a Talisman kit, or to combine two Talismans for a complex spell.
