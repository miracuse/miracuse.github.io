# Magic

>**Player**: I want to throw a big exploding fireball into the middle of the bad guys.
>
>**GM**: That's a bigger spell than you can usually pull off with *Talisman of Fire*. I'll say you either have to get a +3 or give me a Mana Point.

It can be difficult for new players and GM's to get a feel for the baseline power of magic in _Miracuse_. This section provides a few examples to offer some context.

### Other Notes

##### Skill Use

Most uses of Talismans will leverage the Magic skill. The exception to this are Scoundrels, who can spend a Prep Point to _Use a Magic Device_ with Cunning instead.

##### Narrative Context

The uses of a Talisman are decided by the game's fiction, not the text of the kit. For example, _Talisman of Water_ might work on oil or other liquids, if a player can make a convincing case for why it should do so.
