# Mana Points

{% include mana_uses.html %}

The Mage's resource is Mana Points. Unlike other resources, Mana Points have no special features beyond the [usual applications](../../gameplay/resources.md).

### Magic

_Spirit_ Kits tend to be the most versatile type of Kit. While Mages don't have any special uses for their resource, they can create an incredible variety of effects by [empowering and combining kits](../../more/resources/empower_kits.md).
