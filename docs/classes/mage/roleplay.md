<!-- ### Roles

**_In combat..._**

The Mage unleashes unpredictable havoc on the enemy; striking foes blind, sending bolts of lighting across the battlefield, or casting any number of spells to reshape the environment.

**_Socially..._**

The Mage's presence inspires unease among most, though they are beloved by spirits and other natural forces.

**_While exploring..._**

The Mage may call on their spirits to aid in finding hidden locations or communicating with the inhabitants of a foreign land. Their sixth sense can be helpful when dangerous magic is in the air. -->
