# Roleplay

Players are welcome to customize their characters however they choose. However, if they aren't sure where to start, this section can provide some prompts and guidance.

### Suggested Equipment and Appearance

- A staff, wand, book, or other object used in your spellcasting

- An unnatural physical characteristic, such as red irises or glowing tattoos

- Clothing that marks you as a Mage, such as rune-embroidered robes or vestments of faith

- A voice that commands attention in some way, such as a gravelly rasp or tendency to rhyme

### Roles

**_In combat..._**

The Mage unleashes unpredictable havoc on the enemy; striking foes blind, sending bolts of lighting across the battlefield, or casting any number of spells to reshape the environment.

**_Socially..._**

The Mage's presence inspires unease among most, though they are beloved by spirits and other natural forces.

**_While exploring..._**

The Mage may call on their spirits to aid in finding hidden locations or communicating with the inhabitants of a foreign land. Their sixth sense can be helpful when dangerous magic is in the air.
