### Place in Society

Every culture has its own perception of Mages. In some nations magic is considered a privilege of nobility. Anyone incapable of channeling the spirits is deemed unfit to rule. In others, demonstrating an aptitude for magic results in forced adoption to a church, a temple, a coven, or other organization. It isn't uncommon for the life of a Mage to border on slavery in lands where magic is feared.

No nation, however, throws away its Mages. Practitioners are universally recognized as a powerful resource. If they are not the rulers of a country, then they are kept tightly controlled by those who do. 

Example Concepts:

* An escaped slave magician, fleeing from bounty hunters

* A member of high nobility, developing their skills as an adventurer

* A priestess of a benign spirit, charged by her order to exorcise agents of a dark god

### Presence

> **Tip:** The most common uses of Presence are to **identify magical forces at play** and **bend others to your will**.

The Mage's social skill allows them to sense supernatural disturbances and charm others into doing their bidding. **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>** is used when a player wants to understand magical elements in an area. "Does the magic in this place feel evil?" "Can I tell what the spell on that door does?"

It's also used influence the minds of others. A Mage can muddle the mind of a disinterested guard, "These are not the adventurers you're looking for". They can make themselves appear more attractive to the eyes of a merchant, or create an unnerving sense of dread to make animals anxious.

However, their influence is intended to be subtle rather than overt. Those who realize they're being charmed can break away with ease, and are often furious at having been manipulated. Many jurisdictions consider the exercise of **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>** to be a form of assault.

### Magical Traditions

> **Tip:** Players interested in a character concept that draws power from within can reflavor "Talisman" kits as prepared spells, the favor of spirits, or something else.

Most Mages require some form of medium to conduct otherworldly energies into their bodies. Various traditions exist that dictate what those mediums are and how they are used, though the resulting magic will be similar in shape and power no matter the implement. A few examples are given below:

* **Wands**: The most common kind of Talisman, favored for their portability.

* **Prayer Beads**: A frequent choice among religious practitioners. The beads are carved with iconography of saints and demigods.

* **Ofuda**: Paper Talismans with ornate symbols drawn upon them. Often burned in the process of casting.

* **Runes**: Sigils of great power, said to represent the true names of spirits and carved onto precious gems.

* **Pacts**: Stylized contracts with spirits, commonly engraved into stone tablets.

<!-- ### Roles

**_In combat..._**

The Mage unleashes unpredictable havoc on the enemy; striking foes blind, sending bolts of lighting across the battlefield, or casting any number of spells to reshape the environment.

**_Socially..._**

The Mage's presence inspires unease among most, though they are beloved by spirits and other natural forces.

**_While exploring..._**

The Mage may call on their spirits to aid in finding hidden locations or communicating with the inhabitants of a foreign land. Their sixth sense can be helpful when dangerous magic is in the air. -->
