### Spirits and Talismans

There are worlds beyond this one and strange things live within them. Things that some call gods, or spirits, or the Platonic ideals of natural phenomenon. "Mage" is a title, sometimes a slur, for someone that taps into these fonts to perform miracles.

Practitioners vary between societies and traditions. It's common across many regions for magic to be inherited through bloodlines, though whether this is due to some natural predisposition or simply the inheritance of a trade is in dispute. Other lands believe magic to be a holy calling for priests, or the despicable practice of cowards. In a few, aristocratic clubs exist that regard the practice of magic to be an essential part of a gentleman's education.

The majority of traditions center around the use of Talismans, objects of symbolic importance that act as conduits for otherworldly energy. Each talisman is attuned to a particular spirit and reflects their aspect. A spirit of earth, for example, might resonate with a wand made of quartz crystal.

<!--
Unlike Alchemy, casting spells is rarely a matter of **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>**. There may be rituals and names to memorize, but **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** is ultimately an expression of spirit and instinct. A Mage must have honed their inner selves to withstand currents of foreign energy and trained their bodies to redirect it. -->

<!-- One can usually tell a true Mage from a dabbler. Regular exposure to otherworldly influences leads to stigmata; strangely colored eyes, an odd ring to one's voice, or the gradual formation of sigils on skin. The more marked the practitioner, the more powerful, and often the less sane. These characteristics are often accompanied by a unique **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>**, a supernatural charisma with the capacity to enthrall those with weak wills. -->

### Place in Society

Every culture has its own perception of Mages. In some nations magic is considered a privilege of nobility. Anyone incapable of channeling the spirits is deemed unfit to rule. In others, demonstrating an aptitude for magic results in forced adoption to a church, a temple, a coven, or other organization. It isn't uncommon for the life of a Mage to border on slavery in lands where magic is feared.

No nation, however, throws away its Mages. Practitioners are universally recognized as a powerful resource. If they are not the rulers of a country, then they are kept tightly controlled by those who do.

Example Concepts:

- An escaped slave magician, fleeing from bounty hunters

- A member of high nobility, developing their skills as an adventurer

- A priestess of a benign spirit, charged by her order to exorcise agents of a dark god

### Magical Traditions

> **Tip:** Players interested in a character concept that draws power from within can reflavor "Talisman" kits as prepared spells, the favor of spirits, or something else.

Most Mages require some form of medium to conduct otherworldly energies into their bodies. Various traditions exist that dictate what those mediums are and how they are used, though the resulting magic will be similar in shape and power no matter the implement. A few examples are given below:

- **Wands**: The most common kind of Talisman, favored for their portability.

- **Prayer Beads**: A frequent choice among religious practitioners. The beads are carved with iconography of saints and demigods.

- **Ofuda**: Paper Talismans with ornate symbols drawn upon them. Often burned in the process of casting.

- **Runes**: Sigils of great power, said to represent the true names of spirits and carved onto precious gems.

- **Pacts**: Stylized contracts with spirits, commonly engraved into stone tablets.

### Roles

**_In combat..._**

The Mage is a capable ranged fighter, using **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** to cause harm and change the shape of the battle.  They have little in the way of **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>** or **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>** and generally avoid close combat. 

**_Socially..._**

The Mage's **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>** can be used to beguile and charm the unwary. Those with stronger wills are less likely to be affected, and more likely to react violently to failed attempts. 

**_While exploring..._**

The Mage feels out areas for strange or hostile magic using **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>**. They are experts on all things otherworldly and arcane.
