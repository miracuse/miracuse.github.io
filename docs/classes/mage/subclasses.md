# Subclasses

**Subclasses** are specializations for each class that determine which [Kits](kits.md) a player can use. New characters start with one subclass, gaining more the longer they adventure.

-   **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Shaman</span>**: A Mage that trained in elemental magic, combining the primal forces of fire, earth, water, air, lightning, and metal.

-   **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Priest</span>**: A Mage that draws power from otherworldly forces, capable of treating wounds, raising the dead, and performing miracles.

-   **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Wizard</span>**: A Mage that manipulates physical forces, such as heat, gravity, and kinetic energy.
