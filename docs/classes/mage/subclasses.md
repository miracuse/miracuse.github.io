# Subclasses

**Subclasses** are specializations for each class that determine which [Kits](kits.md) a player can use. New characters start with one subclass, gaining more the longer they adventure. Additional information can be found on the [subclass page](../subclasses.html).

### <span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">The Priest</span>

A Mage that arbitrates between worlds. The Priest enforces boundaries. They govern over the living and the dead, the worldly and the otherworldly. They can pull strange forces into the world or push them out.

### <span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">The Shaman</span> 

A Mage that draws upon the elements. The Shaman's strength stems from their deep connection to fire, water, earth, wind, aether, and metal. The symbolic importance of each element, and the balance between them, are as relevant as their physical presence.

### <span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">The Wizard</span> 

A Mage that manipulates fundamental forces. The Wizard studies reality. They control speed, heat, gravity, decay, and energy. Their abilities are more analytical than mystical, but equally potent.
