# The Scoundrel

The Scoundrel is a master of misdirection. They blend in with crowds and shadows, only revealing themselves when the time is right. Many employ their talents as hunters or merchants, though it's just as common to see them working as thieves and assassins.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>**: Scoundrels are quick on their feet. They use this Skill when making swift strikes or defending against Physical attacks. Agility also determines who acts first in a conflict, as well as the Scoundrel's ability to scale walls and sprint away from danger.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>**: Scoundrels are sly. They use this Skill to talk circles around others, to [move unnoticed](../../gameplay/exploration/stealth.md), and to sense danger or lies. Cunning also determines how many Prep Points a Scoundrel has.

- **[Prep Points](#prep-points)**: The Scoundrel's resource lets them disappear from sight, disguise themselves both in appearance and behavior, perform **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** with the aid of tools, and reach out to their various social contacts for favors.

### Prep Points

Scoundrels always have a few tricks up their sleeves. These are represented as **Prep Points** and can be used for the following:

- **Disappear From Sight**: Make a hasty getaway, vanishing from sight even in the middle of combat.

- **Produce a Disguise**: Impersonate others, assume a false identity, or simply camouflage yourself to better blend in.

- **Use a Magic Device**: Pull out a charm, gem, or other charged object to use a Talisman with **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>** instead of **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**. The object is depleted after a single use.

- **I Know a Guy**: Declare that you just so happen to have a contact in the area that owes you a favor, and can help with your present situation.

### Cunning

> **Tip**: The most common uses of Cunning are **stealth**, **danger sense**, and **deceiving others**.

The Scoundrel's social skill allows them to move without attracting notice, to sense impending harm, and to bluff. **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>** is used for all manner of "thief-like" behavior.

### Specializations

### <span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">The Assassin</span>

Expert infiltrators proficient in the use of poisons. Their weapon of choice are "thorns", small needles that can be discretely thrown or attached to the ends of arrows. Though not formally organized under a guild, Assassins tend to operate in a loose network of criminal organizations.

### <span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">The Bard</span>

Members of a courier's guild, trained in a little magic, a little stage alchemy, and the art of throwing knives. Bards are frequently employed as messengers, entertainers, spies, and legal consul. Their social position is nebulous enough that they can comfortably interact with aristocrats and peasants.

### <span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">The Ranger</span>

A catch-all term for hunters, tribal warriors, and nomads. Skilled archers with an affinity for nature, whose traditional medicines predate the modern practice of alchemy.
