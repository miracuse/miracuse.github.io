# The Scoundrel

The Scoundrel is a master of misdirection. They blend in with crowds and shadows, only revealing themselves when the time is right. Many employ their talents as hunters or merchants, though it's just as common to see them working as thieves and assassins.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>**: Scoundrels are quick on their feet. They use this Skill when making swift strikes or defending against Physical attacks. Agility also determines who acts first in a conflict, as well as the Scoundrel's ability to scale walls and sprint away from danger.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>**: Scoundrels are sly. They use this Skill to talk circles around others, to [move unnoticed](../../gameplay/exploration/stealth.md), and to sense danger or lies. Cunning also determines how many Prep Points a Scoundrel has.

### Prep

Scoundrels have a number of Prep Points equal to two times their **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>**. Prep Points can be used to:

- **Disappear From Sight** even in the middle of combat.

- **Assume a Disguise** to infiltrate, confuse, or assume an alias.

- Declare "**I Know a Guy**", describing an NPC that can help your party in some way, such as a palace guard that owes you a favor.

- Use _Spirit_ Kits with **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>** or **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>** instead of **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**.

- **Empower** Kits with the _Technique_, _Spirit_, or _Alchemy_ tags.

### Techniques, Magic, and Alchemy

Scoundrels borrow a little bit from all of the other classes. Their Prep Points can be used to empower Kits with the [Technique](../soldier/#techniques), [Spirit](../mage/#magic), or [Alchemy](../alchemist/#charges) tags, making them exceptionally versatile.
