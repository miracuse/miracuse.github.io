# The Scoundrel

The Scoundrel is a master of misdirection. They blend in with crowds and shadows, only revealing themselves when the time is right. Many employ their talents as hunters or merchants, though it's just as common to see them working as thieves and assassins.

-   **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>**: Scoundrels are quick on their feet. They use this Skill when making swift strikes or defending against Physical attacks. Agility also determines who acts first in a conflict, as well as the Scoundrel's ability to scale walls and sprint away from danger.

-   **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>**: Scoundrels are sly. They use this Skill to talk circles around others, to [move unnoticed](../../gameplay/exploration/stealth.md), and to sense danger or lies. Cunning also determines how many Prep Points a Scoundrel has.

### Prep

Scoundrels have a number of Prep Points equal to two times their **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>**. Prep Points can be used to:

-   **Change a Kit** without [making camp](../../adventuring/exploration/#making_camp).

-   **Assume a Disguise** to infiltrate or confuse.

-   Declare "**I Know a Guy**", describing an NPC that can help your party in some way, such as a palace guard that owes you a favor.

-   Declare that you have "**What You Needed**", describing an item that can help you with the problem at hand, such as a bribe or a tool.
