# The Scoundrel

The Scoundrel is a master of misdirection. They blend in with crowds and shadows, only revealing themselves when the time is right. Many employ their talents as hunters or merchants, though it's just as common to see them working as thieves and assassins.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>**: Scoundrels are quick on their feet. They use this Skill when making swift strikes or defending against Physical attacks. Agility also determines who acts first in a conflict, as well as the Scoundrel's ability to scale walls and sprint away from danger.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>**: Scoundrels are sly. They use this Skill to talk circles around others, to [move unnoticed](../../gameplay/exploration/stealth.md), and to sense danger or lies. Cunning also determines how many Prep Points a Scoundrel has.

- **[Prep Points](#prep-points)**: The Scoundrel's resource lets them disappear from sight, disguise themselves both in appearance and behavior, perform **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** with the aid of tools, and reach out to their various social contacts for favors.

### Rogue

A Scoundrel is someone caught between worlds. Hunters, between civilization and nature. Spies, between two masters. Thieves, between polite society and its cruel underbelly. A Scoundrel knows the importance of _seeming_. What others call "deceit" they call survival. 

They are not Alchemists, but they dabble in alchemy. They are not Mages, but they can perform a few spells. They are not Soldiers, but they can hold their own in a fight. Above all, a Scoundrel is someone who understands that survival is dependent on adaptability. And that no amount alchemic knowledge, arcane might, or martial prowess can keep you safe while you sleep.

### Prep Points

Scoundrels always have a few tricks up their sleeves. These are represented as **Prep Points** and can be used for the following:

* **Disappear From Sight**: Make a hasty getaway, vanishing from sight even in the middle of combat.

* **Produce a Disguise**: Impersonate others, assume a false identity, or simply camouflage yourself to better blend in.

* **Use a Magic Device**: Pull out a charm, gem, or other charged object to use a Talisman with a Skill other than **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**. The object is depleted after a single use.

* **I Know a Guy**: Declare that you just so happen to have a contact in the area that owes you a favor, and can help with your present situation.
