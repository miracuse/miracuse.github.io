# The Scoundrel

The Scoundrel is a master of misdirection. They blend in with crowds and shadows, only revealing themselves when the time is right. Many employ their talents as hunters or merchants, though it's just as common to see them working as thieves and assassins.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>**: Scoundrels are quick on their feet. They use this Skill when making swift strikes or defending against Physical attacks. Agility also determines who acts first in a conflict, as well as the Scoundrel's ability to scale walls and sprint away from danger.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>**: Scoundrels are sly. They use this Skill to talk circles around others, to [move unnoticed](../../gameplay/exploration/stealth.md), and to sense danger or lies. Cunning also determines how many Tricks a Scoundrel has.

- **[Tricks](#tricks)**: Scoundrels have a great many tricks up their sleeves, ranging from favors owed by local contacts to minor magical artifacts.

### Tricks

**<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>** adventurers know that there's more than one way to solve any given problem. They keep a variety of **Tricks** handy.

- **I Know a Guy**: Declare that you just so happen to have a contact in the area that owes you a favor, and can help with your present situation.

- **What You Needed**: Declare that you have an unlikely item, such as a smoke bomb or valuable bribe, that can help with the current situation.

- **Use Magic Device**: Substitute a Trick box for a Mana box to mimic the Mage's [Perform High Magic](../mage/index.html#mana).

### Specializations

### <span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">The Assassin</span>

Expert infiltrators proficient in the use of poisons. Their weapon of choice are "thorns", small needles that can be discretely thrown or attached to the ends of arrows. Though not formally organized under a guild, [Assassins](../../more/specializations/assassin.html) tend to operate in a loose network of criminal organizations.

### <span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">The Bard</span>

Members of a courier's guild, trained in a little magic, a little stage alchemy, and the art of throwing knives. [Bards](../../more/specializations/bard.html) are frequently employed as messengers, entertainers, spies, and legal consul. Their social position is nebulous enough that they can comfortably interact with aristocrats and peasants.

### <span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">The Ranger</span>

A catch-all term for those trained in a martial tradition popularized by the Tribes. [Rangers](../../more/specializations/ranger.html) are fleet-footed warriors with an affinity for the natural world. Their ability to control and communicate with wildlife makes them highly sought after as guides and monster hunters.
