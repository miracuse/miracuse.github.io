# The Scoundrel

The Scoundrel is a master of misdirection. They blend in with crowds and shadows, only revealing themselves when the time is right. Many employ their talents as hunters or merchants, though it's just as common to see them working as thieves and assassins.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>**: Scoundrels are quick on their feet. They use this Skill when making swift strikes or defending against Physical attacks. Agility also determines who acts first in a conflict, as well as the Scoundrel's ability to scale walls and sprint away from danger.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>**: Scoundrels are sly. They use this Skill to talk circles around others, to [move unnoticed](../../gameplay/exploration/stealth.md), and to sense danger or lies. Cunning also determines how many Tricks a Scoundrel has.

- **[Tricks](#tricks)**: Scoundrels have a great many tricks up their sleeves, ranging from favors owed by local contacts to minor magical artifacts.

### Tricks

**<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>** adventurers know that there's more than one way to solve any given problem. They keep a variety of **Tricks** handy.

- **I Know a Guy**: Declare that you just so happen to have a contact in the area that owes you a favor, and can help with your present situation.

- **What You Needed**: Declare that you have an unlikely item, such as a smoke bomb or valuable bribe, that can help with the current situation.

- **Use Magic Device**: Substitute a Trick box for a Mana box to mimic the Mage's [Perform High Magic](../mage/index.html#mana).

### Cunning

> **Tip**: The most common uses of Cunning are **stealth**, **danger sense**, and **deceiving others**.

The Scoundrel's social skill allows them to move without attracting notice, to sense impending harm, and to bluff. **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>** is used for all manner of "thief-like" behavior.
