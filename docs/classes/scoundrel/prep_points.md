# Prep Points

{% include prep_uses.html %}

The Scoundrel's resource is Prep Points. In addition to the [usual applications](../../gameplay/resources.md), Prep Points can be spent to:

- **Disappear From Sight** even in the middle of combat.

- **Assume a Disguise** to infiltrate, confuse, or assume an alias.

- Declare "**I Know a Guy**", describing an NPC that can help your party in some way, such as a palace guard that owes you a favor.

### Universal Resource

| Class     | Resource       | Skill     | Kit Tag   |
| --------- | -------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Alchemist | Charge Points  | Knowledge | Alchemy   |
| Soldier   | Fortune Points | Bravery   | Technique |
| Mage      | Mana Points    | Presence  | Spirit    |
| Scoundrel | Prep Points    | Cunning   | Any       |

While other [resources](../../gameplay/resources.md) are tied to a specific type of kit, Prep Points can be used to [empower and combine kits](../../more/resources/empower_kits.md) with any tag.
