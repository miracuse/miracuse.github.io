# Roleplay

Players are welcome to customize their characters however they choose. However, if they aren't sure where to start, this section can provide some prompts and guidance.

### Suggested Equipment and Appearance

- An easily hidden melee weapon, such as a dagger or garrote

- An unassuming ranged weapon, such as throwing knives or a shortbow

- Inconspicuous clothes for traveling, and fashionable dress for formal affairs

- Lockpicks, wire cutters, and other thieves' tools hidden on your person

### Roles

**_In combat..._**

The Scoundrel waits for the right opportunity to make a [Sneak Attack](). Once exposed they might make a hasty getaway, or throw themselves into the fight with a frenzy of **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agile</span>** strikes.

**_Socially..._**

The Scoundrel is an expert at **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>**. They can fast-talk, bluff, and sense the motivations of others. They're able to **Assume a Disguise**, helping the party gain access to areas otherwise off-limits, and may **Know A Guy** who can help with the tasks at hand.

**_While exploring..._**

The Scoundrel is nearly always the scout of a party. They can move carefully through dangerous areas, ever ready to book a fast retreat should danger arise. They also have **What You Needed**, which might be anything from a grappling hook to a bottle of lamp oil.
