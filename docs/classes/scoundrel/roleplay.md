### Rogue

A Scoundrel is someone caught between worlds. Hunters, between civilization and nature. Spies, between two masters. Thieves, between polite society and its cruel underbelly. A Scoundrel knows the importance of _seeming_. What others call "deceit" they call survival.

They are not Alchemists, but they dabble in alchemy. They are not Mages, but they can perform a few spells. They are not Soldiers, but they can hold their own in a fight. Above all, a Scoundrel is someone who understands that survival is dependent on adaptability. And that no amount alchemic knowledge, arcane might, or martial prowess can keep you safe while you sleep.

### Place in Society

Scoundrels are talented at blending in, but they're outsiders at heart. They exist on the outskirts of societies as traveling merchants, foreign emissaries, and criminal elements. Their uncertain position gives them the freedom to flaunt social norms, though at the price of always being under suspicion.

Example Concepts:

- A royal cartographer updating world maps for a distant emperor

- A professional thief-catcher that does work for law enforcement agencies

- A young Skald sent out from their tribe to bring back stories of the world beyond their native lands

### Sneak Attack

Scoundrels aren't as dedicated the art of war as Soldiers, but they're still formidable opponents. One of their greatest assets is the ability to strike when an enemy least expects it.

**Sneak Attacks** are any attack made while an enemy is unaware of you. Unlike normal attacks, no roll is required. A Sneak Attack has the same outcome as the best possible roll (+2). There are very few enemies that can avoid harm from an attack that they can't see.

### Use Magic Device

> **Tip**: Scoundrels can spend a Trick box to use Talismans with **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>** instead of **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**.

Magic has been around for as long as history can recall. And in that time, many individuals have coveted its power despite lacking training or aptitude. Unorthodox methods gradually came into being to allow lay persons brief access to the spirits. Many of these methods exist in a grey legal area, where they aren't outright banned for the dangers they represent.

- **Mage Blood**: Some spirits seem happy enough to accept Mage blood in exchange for power, regardless of whether or not the Mage is present.

- **Arcane Focus**: A reservoir of power, usually in the form of a crystal, that a Mage has prepared in advance. Sold in alley markets for a tidy profit.

- **Favor**: A few spirits and their servants are able to bequeath a "favor" in exchange for services rendered. In the best scenario the spirit in question has offered a benign reward. In the worst, the spirit seeks to spread its influence by corrupting mortals for petty wishes.

- **Sacrifice**: Some of the oldest magic traditions were built around the ritual sacrifice of rare animals and precious goods. A number of those rituals still hold power.

### Roles

**_In combat..._**

The Scoundrel is a capable combatant, able to switch between close- and far-ranged **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>** attacks with ease. Their [Sneak Attacks](../../adventuring/exploration/stealth.html) are brutally effective, especially when combined with Weapon kits. Though not as hardy as a Soldier, they are swift enough to avoid most attacks.

**_Socially..._**

The Scoundrel is an expert at **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>**. They can fast-talk, bluff, and sense the motivations of others. They're able to _Assume a Disguise_, helping the party gain access to areas otherwise off-limits, and may _Know A Guy_ who can help with the tasks at hand.

**_While exploring..._**

The Scoundrel is a capable [scout](../../adventuring/exploration/stealth.html). They can move carefully through dangerous areas, ever ready to book a fast retreat should danger arise. Their **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>** can be used to sense danger before it blossoms into a full-blown problem.
