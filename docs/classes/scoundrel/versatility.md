# Versatility

> **Player**: I'm going to use _Talisman of Light_ to create the illusion of a wall over the door we just went through.
>
> **GM**: Okay. Do you want to roll Magic, or spend a Trick to roll Cunning?

Scoundrels are able to use Alchemy, Weapon, and Talisman kits, making them the best all-rounders in _Miracuse_. A handful of examples are presented on this page.
