# Versatility

> **Player**: I'm going to use _Talisman of Light_ to create the illusion of a wall over the door we just went through.
> 
> **GM**: Okay. Do you want to roll Magic, or spend a Prep Point to roll Cunning?

Scoundrels are able to use Alchemy, Weapon, and Talisman kits, making them the best all-rounders in _Miracuse_. A handful of examples are presented on this page.

### Kit Usage Examples

> **Tip**: Prep Points cannot be used to amplify Kits. Instead, they can be spent on _Use a Magic Device_ to roll Cunning instead of Magic for Talismans.

### Other Notes

##### Kit Amplification

Although Prep Points can't be used to amplify kits, other resources can. A [more experienced](../../more/advancement/index.html) Scoundrel may have points in Bravery, Knowledge, or Presence, giving them access to Fortune, Charge, and Mana Points respectively.
