# Versatility

Scoundrels are able to use [Alchemy](../alchemist/alchemy.html), [Gear](../soldier/gear.html), and [Talisman](../mage/magic.html) kits, making them the best all-rounders in _Miracuse_. A handful of examples are presented on this page.

### Jack of All Trades

A Scoundrel's strength is their flexibility. They can **expend a Trick Box to amplify any kit**, allowing them to pivot most situations in their favor. This even allows them to perform powerful **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** a few times a day, though their lack of aptitude otherwise limits the usefulness of equipped Talismans.

> **Note**: More [experienced](../../more/advancement/index.html) Scoundrels might supplement their abilities with points in skills that add Potions, Fortune, or Mana. Other resources can work just as well as Trick Boxes when amplifying the right kit.
