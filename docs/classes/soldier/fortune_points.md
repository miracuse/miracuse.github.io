# Fortune Points

{% include fortune_uses.html %}

The Soldier's resource is Fortune Points. In addition to the [usual applications](../../gameplay/resources.md), Fortune Points can be spent to:

- **Reroll** any roll the you make up to one additional time.

- **Escape Harm** by negating or greatly reducing damage you would otherwise take.

### Combined Techniques

[Empowering techniques](../../more/resources/empower_kits.md) by creatively combining them can result in interesting effects. For example, the **Smite** kit can knock enemies over by itself. But when combined:

- **Blowback** (Smite + Spellbreak): Expend a Fortune Point to reflect a spell or other magical effect back on its caster.

- **Breakthrough** (Smite + Cleave): Expend a Fortune Point to damage and knockdown a wide arc of enemies in front of you.

- **Obliterate** (Smite + Sunder): Expend a Fortune Point to violently destroy a sturdy object, such as a wall, sending its pieces flying outwards as a projectile attack.
