# Gear

> **Player**: Can I make a hole in the ceiling with the _Vorpal Blade_? Just enough to let in some sunlight.
>
> **GM**: Yeah. The ceiling is pretty thick, but the sword slips through like there's nothing in the way.

Gear kits include weapons, armor, and other equipment that acts as useful tools for interacting with the world.

### Using Gear

{% include example_kit_param.html content="Smiting Mace" %}

The use of Gear depends on what kind of an item it is. **Weapons** will generally be aligned with whatever skill is used to attack (**<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>**, **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>**). Others might have more passive benefits, like preventing certain kinds of damage.

Any piece of Gear can be **amplified by expending a Fortune Box**. Doing so allows a character to briefly exceed the normal use of a kit.

### Other Notes

##### Losing and Breaking Gear

Gear kits are pretty sturdy, but they can be damaged. Depending on the severity the GM may rule:

1. You can't use that kit again until the next time the party [makes camp](../../adventuring/exploration/making_camp.html) and you have time to fix it.

2. You can't use that kit again until the party finds a way to fix or replace it. -->
