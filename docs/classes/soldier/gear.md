# Gear

> **Player**: Can I make a hole in the ceiling with the _Vorpal Blade_? Just enough to let in some sunlight.
>
> **GM**: Yeah. The ceiling is pretty thick, but the sword slips through like there's nothing in the way.

Gear kits include weapons, armor, and other equipment that acts as useful tools for interacting with the world.

### Other Notes

##### Losing and Breaking Gear

Gear kits are pretty sturdy, but they can be damaged. Depending on the severity the GM may rule:

1. You can't use that kit again until the next time the party [makes camp](../../adventuring/exploration/making_camp.html) and you have time to fix it.

2. You can't use that kit again until the party finds a way to fix or replace it.
