# The Soldier

The Soldier is a warrior without peer. They may be knights, bandits, infantrymen, or come from other walks of life. What makes one a Soldier is not their profession but their skill at arms, courage, and a surprising amount of luck.

### Specializations

### <span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Blademaster</span>

Recognized masters of the sword, in great demand across the world as mercenaries and bodyguards. [Blademasters](../../more/specializations/blademaster.html) carry a collection of enchanted and alchemically-enhanced blades that require years of study to properly wield. The best known are the "Vorpal Swords", liquid metal blades whose unmatched sharpness makes them unusable by those without training.

### <span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Knight</span>

A warrior sworn to uphold a code of honor, one who employs their skills towards noble ends. [Knights](../../more/specializations/knight.html) are recognized by their holy swords, but are trained with a variety of weapons and tools. Knighthood orders are held in particularly high esteem, and are empowered to act as civil officials in times of need.

### <span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Legionnaire</span>

Part combatant, part laborer, the [Legionnaire](../../more/specializations/legionnaire.html) is an experiment in enhancing traditional infantry with alchemy. Their equipment strongly resembles standard issue gear, but a series of modifications puts their capability well above basic spears and shields. Legionnaires are often distinguished by their skill in construction, able to leverage a portable alchemical cement to build bridges, roads, and encampments while on the march.
