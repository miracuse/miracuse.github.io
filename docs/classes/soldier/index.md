# The Soldier

The Soldier is a warrior without peer. They may be knights, bandits, infantrymen, or come from other walks of life. What makes one a Soldier is not their profession but their skill at arms, courage, and a surprising amount of luck.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>**: Soldiers are strong and resilient. They use this Skill when attacking with most weapons or defending against Physical attacks. This Skill also gives them more Physical [Health](../../gameplay/health.md) than other classes.

- **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Bravery</span>**: Soldiers don't break in the face of danger. They use this Skill when defending against Mental attacks. It also determines how many Fortune Points they have, and can be used to provoke, intimidate, or impress others.

- **[Fortune Points](#fortune-points)**: The Soldier's resource allows them to reroll dice and avoid harm. They can also spend points to perform near-impossible feats of martial prowess, amplifying their _Weapon_ Kits.

### Career 

Unlike common footmen, Soldiers have distinguished themselves as expert combatants. They enjoy (or suffer from) a reputation among the general public. Many have monikers such as, "The Lion's Roar" or "The Templar Prince", earned through great deeds. 

Soldiers are also known by the equipment they bear. The rising prevalence of alchemy has made enchanted weaponry more common than ever before, and a veteran Soldier can expect to accumulate a small arsenal over the length of their career. Each is designed in such a way that they can be disassembled and stored on one's person when not in use.

But beyond reputation and armaments, the true mark of a Soldier is an uncanny air of intensity. A Soldier's full regard can feel as suffocating as iron. Their contempt, like needles under skin. And their praise, like the sun itself. Most make an effort to muffle this phenomenon in their day-to-day lives. But used deliberately, it can be a powerful tool for coercing others.


<!-- A Soldier starts their career as an ordinary fighter. A conscript in a noble's army, or a vagabond in a bandit camp are both common origins. They learn their way around a weapon and might have a few skirmishes under their belt. But there is a moment when _something_ changes. For some it's a near-death experience. For others, a glorious victory against the odds. Whatever the cause, they are never quite the same after.

Soldiers are marked. By the grudges of their enemies, by the reputation they've earned in battle, or (according to some) by dark spirits. They wear an air of danger, or perhaps **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Bravery</span>**, that presses against the senses of those around them. A Soldier's full regard can feel as suffocating as iron. Their contempt, like needles under skin. And their praise, like the sun itself.

Unless they let their emotions run wild, a Soldier appears the same as any other knight errant or sellsword. A touch luckier, they claim. A little more skilled than others, they boast. But in their heart of hearts a Soldier knows that they're different. Whatever mark they carry bears them forward towards greater glory or brutal death. -->

### Fortune Points

Soldiers have an unusual relationship with luck, able to occasionally pull on the threads of chance in times of great need. These flares of energy are represented as **Fortune Points** and can be used for the following:

* **Amplify a Weapon**: Empower an equipped Weapon to go far beyond its usual usage.

* **Avoid Harm**: Negate or greatly the reduce harm from an incoming threat.

* **Reroll**: Change the outcome of a roll by rolling again and taking the new result, a maximum of one time per action.
