### Place in Society

Although the term implies a formal military role, "Soldier" can cover a variety of character concepts. Martial prowess is a universally recognized asset in a dangerous world, and most societies will treat members of the class respectfully regardless of background. 

Example Concepts:

* A warrior chieftain with a collection of ancestral weapons

* A knight errant questing in pilgrimage with his master's sword

* A bounty hunter pursuing a notorious criminal

### Bravery

> **Tip**: The three most common uses of Bravery are **intimidation**, **provocation**, and **inspiration**.

The Soldier's social skill is focused on emotional persuasion. **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Bravery</span>** could be used to cow a group of bandits into submission, relying on a character's reputation and frightening competency. It could also be used to rally a peasant militia in defense of their town or taunt an arrogant noble into a duel. More generally, the three most common applications are:

### Weaponry

> **Tip**: Players interested in creating a character with a single weapon can reflavor "Weapon" kits as techniques.

Soldiers are easy to spot. No one would openly carry around enchanted weapons unless they were confident in their ability to deal with prospective thieves. Likewise, few thieves are desperate enough to try taking a magical sword from someone that earns their pay using it. 

Given the expense involved in their creation, it's unsurprising that the majority of imbued weaponry is designed for melee combat. Recent innovations in alchemy have led to the production of relatively inexpensive ranged weapons, but the norm continues to be reusable swords, shields, and similar tools.

Firearms, though potent, remain a trade secret of the Alchemists. Few Soldiers see the use in training with weapons that they cannot reliable keep loaded. Rumors of misfires and accidental explosions discourage any from experimenting with grenades.
