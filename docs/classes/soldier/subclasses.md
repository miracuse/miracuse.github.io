# Subclasses

**Subclasses** are specializations for each class that determine which [Kits](kits.md) a player can use. New characters start with one subclass, gaining more the longer they adventure. Additional information can be found on the [subclass page](../subclasses.html).

-   **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Fencer</span>**: An Soldier trained in a wide variety of combat techniques.

-   **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Knight</span>**: An Soldier hardier than most, with access to Kits that protect others.

-   **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Myrmidon</span>**: An Soldier with abundant luck and a specialization in offense.
