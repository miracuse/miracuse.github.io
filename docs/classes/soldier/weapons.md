# Weapons

> **Player**: Can I make a hole in the ceiling with the _Vorpal Blade_? Just enough to let in some sunlight.
>
> **GM**: Yeah. The ceiling is pretty thick, but the sword slips through like there's nothing in the way.

Weapon kits add extra effects to attacks and act as useful tools for interacting with the world. This section provides a few examples.

### Kit Usage Examples

> **Tip**: Fortune boxes can be spent to "Perform Heroics", using a Weapon kit to do something beyond its usual capabilities.

### Other Notes

##### Skill Use

Weapons are usually tied to a skill used for attacking (i.e. Strength, Agility). In some situations, it might make sense to use a different skill. Bravery, for example, might let a knight use some of the more mystic powers in a _Blessed Sword_.

##### Losing and Breaking Weapons

Enchanted weapons are pretty sturdy, but they can be damaged. Depending on the severity the GM may rule:

1. You can't use that Weapon kit again until the next time the party [makes camp](../../adventuring/exploration/making_camp.html) and you have time to fix it.

2. You can't use that Weapon kit again until the party finds a way to fix or replace it.
