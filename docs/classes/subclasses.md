# Subclasses

{% include example_kit_2.html %}

**Subclasses** are specializations for each class that determine which [Kits](kits.md) a player can use. New characters start with one subclass, gaining more the [longer they adventure](../adventuring/advancement.md).

Each Subclass contains six Kits built around a specific theme. For instance, the _Knight_ subclass for **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Soldiers</span>** has Kits that improve defense, protect allies, and provide the ability to heal.
