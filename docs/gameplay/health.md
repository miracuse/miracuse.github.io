# Health

    Physical Health   ☐ ☐ ☐

    Mental Health     ☐ ☐ ☐

**Health** is measured in **Boxes**. Whenever a character takes damage, they mark a Box in either the Physical or Mental health tracks.

### Three Strikes, You're Out

    GM:     The giant scorpion gets past your guard and stabs you.
            Mark a box of Physical damage.

    Player: That's my last box.

    GM:     Alright. You're down for the count until someone can
            heal you. Don't forget that you're Injured too.

A character that marks all of their boxes in either health track is taken out of play for a short time. They become **Incapacitated** and **Injured**.

- **Incapacitated** characters cannot act until at least one box of their filled track is clear. They also can't be damaged any further.

- **Injured** characters take a -1 penalty to most rolls until they rest at camp. A character can only have one injury at a time. Any further injuries sustained have no mechanical impact.

> **Note**: Each point in the **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>** Skill adds a Box to the Physical Health track. Likewise, each point in the **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>** Skill adds a Box to the Mental Health track.

<!-- ### Recovery

Characters recover all of their health and clear away all injuries by [Making Camp](../adventuring/exploration/index.md).

Certain Kits can also give characters the ability to recover Boxes or treat injuries. See the page on [Healing](../more_resources/healing.md) for more information. -->
