# Health

> **GM**: The giant scorpion gets past your guard and stabs you. Mark a box of Physical damage.
>
> **Player**: That's my last box.
>
> **GM**: Alright. You're down for the count until someone can heal you. 

**Health** is measured in **Boxes**. Whenever a character takes damage, they mark a box in either the Physical or Mental health tracks.

### Three Strikes, You're Out

> {% include health_track_example.html %}


A character that marks all of their boxes in either health track is taken out of play for a short time, becoming **Incapacitated**. Incapacitated characters cannot act until at least one box of their filled track is clear. They also can't be damaged any further.

##### Getting Tougher

Each point in the **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>** Skill adds an additional box to the Physical Health track.

Likewise, each point in the **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>** Skill adds an additional box to the Mental Health track.

<!-- ### Recovery

Characters recover all of their health and clear away all injuries by [Making Camp](../adventuring/exploration/index.md).

Certain Kits can also give characters the ability to recover Boxes or treat injuries. See the page on [Healing](../more_resources/healing.md) for more information. -->
