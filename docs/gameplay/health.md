# Health

While adventuring, characters are guaranteed to find themselves in harm's way. When this happens the GM will tell you to mark Physical or Mental [damage](../gameplay/combat/damage.md).

| Damage Tracks |     |     |     |
| ------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| Physical      | ☑   | ☐   | ☐   |
| Mental        | ☐   | ☐   | ☐   |

### Being Taken Out

A character that marks all of their boxes in either track is taken out of play for a short time. They become **incapacitated** and **injured**.

-   **Incapacitated** characters cannot act until at least one box of their filled track is clear.

-   **Injured** characters take a -1 penalty to rolls until they rest at camp.

### Overflow Damage and Injuries

When incapacitated, any additional damage has no effect.

Likewise, characters can only have one Physical and one Mental injury at a time. Becoming incapacitated with an injury will not cause any additional effects.

### Recovery

Characters recover all of their health and injuries by [Making Camp](../adventuring/exploration/index.md).

Certain Kits can also enable characters to heal. See the page on [Healing](../more_resources/healing.md) for more information.
