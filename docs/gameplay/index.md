# Gameplay

> **GM:** You enter the dark cave and smell something rotten. What do you do?
>
> **Player:** I want to use my fire magic to create a light.
>
> **GM:** Okay, that's pretty easy. Roll Magic and try to get at least a +1.
>
> **Player:** I rolled a +1, and my character starts with a +2. So, I have a +3 total.
>
> **GM:** Alright. The room brightens immediately. You see skeletons all over the floor. The skeletons look up and see you too.

The GM sets the scene and the Players react. Gameplay rules describe how that process works.

- [**Skills**](skills.md) describe what your character is good at.

- [**Kits**](kits.md) are powerful items that your character has. They can be swapped for other kits every time the party [Makes Camp](../adventuring/exploration/making_camp.html).

- [**Health**](health.md) describes how much damage your character can take before they fall over from exhaustion and injury.

- [**Resources**](resources.md) describe limited-use "points" that characters can draw on to pull off complex spells, powerful techniques, or advanced alchemy. These points recharge after [Making Camp](../adventuring/exploration/making_camp.html).
