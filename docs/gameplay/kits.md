# Kits

**Kits** are special abilities tied to a character's class. Players can equip up to four Kits at any given time, and can change their Kits whenever their characters rest.

### Kit Tags

Each Kit has one or more **Tags** that describe the type of ability it provides.

- **Technique**: Kits that add additional effects to attacks.

- **Spirit**: Kits that let Players perform miracles using the **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** Skill.

- **Alchemy**: Kits that provide abilities related to alchemy.

- **Reaction**: Kits that allow Players to act outside their turn in combat if certain conditions are met.

- **Resource**: Kits that provide additional health or resources like Fortune Points.

### Amplification and Combination

| Tag       | Price                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Technique | Fortune Point, Prep Point, Mental Health Box |
| Spirit    | Mana Point, Prep Point, Mental Health Box    |
| Alchemy   | Charge Point, Prep Point, Mental Health Box  |

Kits with the _Technique_, _Spirit_, or _Alchemy_ tags can be briefly powered up or combined by expending the right [Resource](resources.md). **Amplified** Kits produce much larger effects, while **Combined** Kits create more complex effects.

- **High Impact** (Smite Amplified): Send an enemy flying through the air with an especially forceful swing.

- **Ruin** (Cleave + Sunder): Make a massive attack that hits a wide area of enemies and objects, causing extensive collateral damage.

- **Fireball** (Spirit of Flame Amplified): Create an explosion of flame in a wide area.

- **Sinkhole** (Spirit of Water + Earth): Turn a large area of ground into quicksand.

- **Open Path** (Transmute Shape Amplified): Instantly reshape a wall, creating a large opening to walk through.

- **Hazard Round** (Trenchsteel + Friction Charge): Shoot a bullet that bursts into numerous greased ball bearings, making an area very difficult to traverse.
