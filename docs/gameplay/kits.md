# Kits

**Kits** are special abilities tied to a character's Subclass. Players can equip up to four Kits at any given time, and can change their Kits whenever their characters rest.

### Skills vs. Kits

Skills describe how good a character is at some category of tasks (Strength, Agility, etc.). Kits extend Skills, offering new ways to use them.

Anyone can swing a sword with Strength, but only characters with the _Cleave_ Kit can hit multiple enemies in a single swing. Any Mage can use Magic, but only Mages with the _Spirit of Flame_ Kit can use Magic to control fire.
