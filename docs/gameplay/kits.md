# Kits

**Kits** are special abilities tied to a character's [Class](../classes/index.md). Players can equip up to four Kits at any given time, and can change their Kits whenever their characters rest.

### Skills vs. Kits

Skills describe how good a character is at some category of tasks (**<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>**, **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>**, etc.). Kits extend Skills, offering new ways to use them.

Anyone can swing a sword with **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>**, but only characters with the _Harass_ Kit can use that sword to cause Mental damage. Any Mage can use **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**, but only Mages with the _Spirit of Flame_ Kit can use **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** to control fire.
