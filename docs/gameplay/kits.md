### Specializations

Kits come in groups of six by **[Specializations](../more/specializations/index.html)**. For example, the [Priest](../more/specializations/priest.html) specialization for **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Mages</span>** contains six kits related to divine magic, while the [Shaman](../more/specializations/shaman.html) specialization has six kits related to elemental magic.

New characters start with access to one specialization. As they become [more experienced](../more/advancement/index.html) they unlock additional specializations.

### Kits in Game Fiction

It might seem strange that a character's abilities can change from day to day. Although this is a mechanic of the game, it's worthwhile to consider _why_ this happens from the perspectives of the characters. A few possible explanations are listed below, but Players are welcome to come up with their own.

- An Alchemist can only prepare so many specialized substances and bullets each day. In exchange for their potency, none of them have a very long shelf life, and need to primed whenever camp is made.

- A Soldier can only carry so many weapons on their person at one time. Fortunately, modern weaponry can be disassembled and carried in pieces.

- A Mage knows that spirits' favor waxes and wanes with the alignment of the stars. On any given day, one spirit's power may flow with ease while another's is unreachable.

- A Scoundrel keeps many tricks up their sleeves, but there are only so many pockets to store poisons, wands, and other misbegotten goods.
