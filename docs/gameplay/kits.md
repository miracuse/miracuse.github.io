# Kits

**Kits** are special abilities tied to a character's [Subclass](../classes/subclasses.html). Players can equip up to four Kits at any given time, and can change their Kits whenever their characters rest.

### Skills vs. Kits

Skills describe how good a character is at some category of tasks (**<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>**, **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>**, etc.). Kits extend Skills, offering new ways to use them.

Anyone can swing a sword with **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>**, but characters with the _Harass_ Kit are able to use that sword to cause Mental damage. Similarly, _Spirit_ Kits offer new ways to use **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**, _Alchemy_ Kits offer new ways to use **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Perception</span>** / **<span style="color:{{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>**, and so on.
