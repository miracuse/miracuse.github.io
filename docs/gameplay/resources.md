# Resources

> **Player**: I want to make a bridge out of ice using Talisman of Water so that we can get over the river.
>
> **GM**: That's a big spell. I'll say you can pull it off if you spend a Mana box.

**Resources** are pools of power that characters can draw on to perform incredible feats.

### Resource Tracks

| Class     | Resource | Skill     |
| --------- | -------- | --------- |
| Alchemist | Potions  | Knowledge |
| Soldier   | Fortune  | Bravery   |
| Mage      | Mana     | Presence  |
| Scoundrel | Tricks   | Cunning   |

Like health, resources are measured in boxes, and are affiliated with a specific Skill. Each point in the matching Skill adds two boxes for that resource. See specific [Classes](../classes/index.html) for a full list of what each resource can do.

### Pushing It

Resource points recover after making camp and resting. However, Players can also sacrifice one of their Mental boxes in place of a Resource.

> **Note:** It's possible to incapacitate your character by **Pushing It** and spending your last Mental box.
