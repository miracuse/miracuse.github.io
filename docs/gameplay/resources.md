# Resources

> **Player**: I want to make a bridge out of ice using Talisman of Water so that we can get over the river.
>
> **GM**: That's a big spell. I'll say you can pull it off if you spend a Mana Point.

**Resources** are pools of power that characters can draw on to perform incredible feats.

### Resource Pools

| Class     | Resource       | Skill     |
| --------- | -------------- | --------- |
| Alchemist | Charge Points  | Knowledge |
| Soldier   | Fortune Points | Bravery   |
| Mage      | Mana Points    | Presence  |
| Scoundrel | Prep Points    | Cunning   |

Like health, resources are measured in boxes, and are affiliated with a specific Skill. Each point in the matching Skill adds two boxes for that resource. See specific [Classes](../classes/index.html) for a full list of what each resource can do.

### Amplifying Kits

> **Tip**: Spending a resource will often result in an automatic success, but GM's may still call for a roll if luck is a significant factor in the outcome.

Most resources allow players to "amplify" one of their Kits, bringing out more power than it normally has or creating a narrative effect that's thematically appropriate.

**_Charge Points_**

Used to amplify alchemy kits. For example, taking the _Agua Regia_ acid kit and empowering it to instantly eat a person-sized hole through a stone floor, allowing the players to sneak into the castle basement.

**_Fortune Points_**

Used to amplify weapon kits. For example, taking the _Blessed Sword_ kit and using it to repel a horde of zombies by shining with divine light.

**_Mana Points_**

Used to amplify talisman kits. For example, taking the _Spirit of Gravity_ kit and using it to float an entire wagon of explosives, so that the Soldier can pick it up and throw it at an oncoming army.

***Pushing It***

Resource points recover after making camp and resting. However, Players can also sacrifice one of their Mental boxes in place of a Resource.

> **Note:** It's possible to incapacitate your character by **Pushing It** and spending your last Mental box.
