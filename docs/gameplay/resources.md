# Resources

    Player: I want to make a bridge out of ice using Spirit of Water
            so that we can get over the river.

    GM:     That's a big spell. Mark off a Mana Point and roll Aura for it.

| Class     | Resource       | Skill     |
| --------- | -------------- | --------- |
| Alchemist | Charge Points  | Knowledge |
| Soldier   | Fortune Points | Bravery   |
| Mage      | Mana Points    | Presence  |
| Scoundrel | Prep Points    | Cunning   |

**Resources** are pools of power that characters can draw on to perform incredible feats. Like health, resources are measured in boxes and tied to specific Skills.

### Recovery

    Fortune Points ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐

Resources are completely replenished after [Making Camp](../adventuring/exploration/index.md). Some Kits can restore resources when specific conditions are met.

### Pushing It

    Player: I want to cut through the prison bars and set off a jailbreak.

    GM:     Okay. Do you have any Fortune Points left?

    Player: Nope.

    GM:     Mark a Mental box then.

Players can expend Mental health boxes in places of any Resource when the situation is desperate. Be careful though, a character can incapacitate themselves by using **Pushing It**.
