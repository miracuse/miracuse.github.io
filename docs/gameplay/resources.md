# Resources

    Player: I want to make a bridge out of ice using Spirit of Water
            so that we can get over the river.

    GM:     That's a big spell. Mark off a Mana Point and roll Magic for it.

| Class     | Resource       | Skill     | Kit Tag   |
| --------- | -------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Alchemist | Charge Points  | Knowledge | Alchemy   |
| Soldier   | Fortune Points | Bravery   | Technique |
| Mage      | Mana Points    | Presence  | Spirit    |
| Scoundrel | Prep Points    | Cunning   | Any       |

**Resources** are pools of power that characters can draw on to perform incredible feats. Like health, resources are measured in boxes and tied to specific Skills. Resources can be spent to do any of the following:

- Class Abilities (such as the Alchemist's **Produce a Potion** or the Scoundrel's **Disappear from Sight**)

- [Empowering Kits](../more/resources/empower_kits.md)

- [Combining Kits](../more/resources/empower_kits.md)

- [Skill Substitution](../more/resources/skill_substitution.md)

### Pushing It

Resource points recover after making camp and resting. However, Players can also sacrifice one of their Mental boxes in place of a Resource point.

> **Note:** It's possible to incapacitate your character by **Pushing It** and spending your last Mental box.
