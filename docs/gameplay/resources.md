# Resources

    Player: I want to make a bridge out of ice using Talisman of Water
            so that we can get over the river.

    GM:     That's a big spell. I'll say you can pull it off if you
            spend a Mana Point.

| Class     | Resource       | Skill     | 
| --------- | -------------- | --------- | 
| Alchemist | Charge Points  | Knowledge |
| Soldier   | Fortune Points | Bravery   | 
| Mage      | Mana Points    | Presence  | 
| Scoundrel | Prep Points    | Cunning   | 

**Resources** are pools of power that characters can draw on to perform incredible feats. Like health, resources are measured in boxes and increase when their corresponding Skill increases.

### Pushing It

Resource points recover after making camp and resting. However, Players can also sacrifice one of their Mental boxes in place of a Resource.

> **Note:** It's possible to incapacitate your character by **Pushing It** and spending your last Mental box.
