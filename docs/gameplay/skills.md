# Skills

> **Player**: I want to look around for any traps or secret passages.
>
> **GM**: Okay. Roll Perception or Cunning.
>
> **Player**: I rolled a 9, which gives me a +1. Since I started with a +2 in Cunning, that gives a total of +3.
>
> **GM**: You spot a couple of loose tiles that hook into an arrow trap of some kind. With a +3, I'll say you can disable that if you want to.

Almost anything you do in-game will fall under one of the eight Skills. The level of success depends on a combination of luck and your character's Skill levels.
