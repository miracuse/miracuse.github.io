# First Session

There are a few things you need to take care of before the big day.

1. Make a [dungeon](making_dungeons.html)

2. Fill it with [hazards](making_hazards.html) and [enemies](making_enemies/index.html)

3. Make a [boss](making_enemies/bosses.html)

Not all sessions will follow this pattern, but your first should. A dungeon run is like riding a bike with training wheels or bowling with guard rails. It's best to choose a mission with a clear objective, and plenty of opportunities for players to get the hang of basic mechanics.

> **Tip**: Your first session should be a _oneshot_, a self-contained game that doesn't plan on there being any sequels.

### Introducing the Team

On the day of the session you'll start off by having the players make their characters. _Miracuse_ is designed to keep the [mechanical process](../game_sheets.html) quick and straightforward. Some Players will choose a class and be ready to play in thirty seconds. Others may spend a few minutes exploring the tool, reading documentation, and playing with character concepts. Try to coax everyone towards being ready in ten minutes or less.

When everyone has a class, move into introductions. Have each player provide a name and a description for their character. Use the _Equipment and Appearance_ questions on the Roleplay pages for each class. This will help players flesh out their avatars, giving them life outside their stat blocks.

### Doing Your Job

```
1. Set the Scene

2. React to Player Actions

3. Keep Things Moving
```

Prepping for the big day is the first half of your job. The second half is putting your prep into action. **This will take practice.** Few people develop the ability to improv without spending some time flubbing, drawing blanks, or otherwise making mistakes. The good news is that it will get easier the more you do it.

##### Set the Scene

```
GM:  You find yourselves standing in front of a dark cavern.
     The city mayor has asked you to investigate reports of
     some kind of monster, and you've tracked it to its lair.

     Now that you're here, what do you do?
```

Tell the players where they are and what's around them. Give them a few moments to get into character, get their bearings, etc. Be sure to make the "direction" clear.

>**Note**: Some contrarian players might try to go away from the "direction" of the oneshot to test out their newfound agency. While it's okay to try different approaches to the mission, you should gently remind them that the objective is set in stone for this oneshot. The party can try out more [open-ended gameplay](making_campaigns/index.html) in future sessions.

##### React to Player Actions

```
Player:  I light a torch and enter the cave.

GM:      You see garbage strewn on the floor and gnawed on
         bones. There are primitive paintings on the wall.

Player:  Can I tell what made those paintings?

GM:      Roll Knowledge.
```

Gameplay will gradually fall into a rhythm. You set the scene, a player reacts to the scene, then you react to the player. Both you and the players will gradually get the hang of bouncing ideas back and forth.

##### Keep Things Moving

```
Player:  Alright. We've checked for traps, tested if the door
         is a mimic, and cast a spell to keep people from
         sneaking up on us. What else should do?

GM:      Everyone rolling Cunning or Perception.

         <Players report results>

GM:     Okay. If you had a +1, you hear the sounds of footsteps
        from up ahead. You've got a moment to do something
        before they arrive.
```

Sometimes the party loses their momentum. If you find that the players aren't sure what to do next, or haven't made progress in some time, add an element of chaos to move things forward. Common tricks include:

- Mooks approaching

- A change in the environment (dungeon rumbling, the feeling of bad magic rising)

> **Tip**: Always make dungeons that have more rooms than you need. If the players aren't making much progress, you can cut out rooms to artificially "speed things up".

---

### The Boss Fight

```
GM:   There it is. At the heart of the cave, a massive black
      wolf sits watching you with intelligent red eyes.
      It sits up to its full height and bears its teeth.
      Everyone roll Agility for turn order.
```

You and your players have started to get the hang of the game, and now it's time for the finale.

The [boss](making_enemies/bosses.html) is a little different from your usual run-of-the-mill mook. They roll twice for turn order, and when they get hurt enough, they enter a second phase. Giving the boss a third entry on the turn order is a good way to signal to players that the situation is getting more deadly as the fight goes on.

> **Tip**: Bosses have at least two phases, and it's a good idea to prepare a third just in case. Boss fights should challenge players to use all the resources they have left.

---

### Epilogue

```
GM:   Though badly beaten up, you manage to take the Worg's
      head back to the city mayor. He seems shocked that
      there actually was truth to the rumors, but pays
      you all the same.

      The city throws a celebration in your honor. There's
      dancing, drinking, and all the usual shenanigans.
      Good work everyone.
```

Once the peak moment of drama (usually the boss fight) is over, it's time to wrap things up.

Don't bother forcing the players to backtrack through all the traps and any remaining enemies. Instead, narrate the trek back. Ask the players what their characters do after the mission is over, or ad-lib some short epilogues if you feel comfortable doing so.

When everything is said and done, congratulate yourself on managing your first session! The first one is the hardest, and any future games you run will be better for the experience.
