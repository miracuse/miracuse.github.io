# GM Pages

You are the **Game Master**. That means that you set the scene, react to player actions, and keep the game moving. This section includes tips on how to do that.

GM's running their first game in _Miracuse_ should look over [Setting Difficulty](setting_difficulty_levels.html) and use the advice under [First Session](first_session.html) to prepare a short adventure.

Afterwards, GM's can look over [Making Campaigns](making_campaigns/index.html) for advice on running multi-session adventures.
