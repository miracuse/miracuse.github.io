You are the **Game Master**. That means that you set the scene, react to player actions, and keep the game moving. This section includes tips on how to do that.

GM's running their first game in _Miracuse_ should look over [Setting Difficulty](setting_difficulty_levels.html) and use the advice under [First Session](first_session.html) to prepare a short adventure. Afterwards, GM's can look over [Making Campaigns](making_campaigns/index.html) for advice on running multi-session adventures.

### How _You_ Play the Game

Most of the system mechanics discussed so far cover gameplay for _players_. We've discussed how to create characters, roll dice, use abilities, and so on.

The GM is also playing the game, but their role is fundamentally different. Their play consists of "running the game" and "preparing the game", both of which can be enjoyable.

##### Running the Game

This is the activity that usually comes to mind when GM'ing is discussed. On game days, with players participating, you act as a narrator. You set the scene, the players react to the scene, then you react to the players' actions.

##### Preparing the Game

This is a solo activity you do before game day. This is where you workshop dungeons, come up with plot lines, and brainstorm challenges for the players to face. -->
