Under Construction

> _"As the gamemaster, it’s your job to decide how everyone and everything else in the world responds to what the PCs do, as well as what the PCs’ environment is like. If a PC botches a roll, you’re the one who gets to decide the consequences. When an NPC attempts to assassinate a PC’s friend, you’re the one who gets to decide how they go about it. When the PCs stroll up to a food vendor in a market, you get to decide what kind of day the vendor is having, what kind of personality he or she has, what’s on sale that day. You determine the weather when the PCs pull up to that dark cave."_ - FATE SRD on [Playing the World and the NPCs](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/running-game#play-the-world-and-the-npcs)

Oh boy. You're the GM. The whole world is in your hands, and that means work. It also means that these sections are going to be written more informally. After all, you and I are on a level playing field now. The players follow the rules, but you **make** the rules. That means you can pick and choose out of the pile of stuff I've typed out on this website. You like the Aspect system from [FATE Core](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core)? [Houserule](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules) it back in. Hate how combat works? Change the system. That's what I did.

_Miracuse_ is simpler than systems like D&D in some respects, but harder in others. There are fewer rules to remember (like knowing what each and every spell does), which is nice. However, there are fewer rules, which means you will be doing more improv. One of your players is going to ask you if they can make a fire sword with their fire magic. You're going to have to decide if they can. Will you make them roll for it? Is it even possible? The judgment call is yours.

I designed _Miracuse_ to be easy on GM's wherever possible. The goal was for GM's to spend less time mucking through notes and more time playing the game. And you are playing the game, make no mistake. It's just a different game from the other players. You are a performer, here to make a magnificent show. Whether you use a detailed script or fill-in-the-blanks as you go is up to you.
