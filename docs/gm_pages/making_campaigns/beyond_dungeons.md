# Beyond Dungeons 

There are a great many types of games you can run with _Miracuse_. You and your players might:

* Fight a legal battle to escape wrongful (or otherwise) imprisonment.

* Solve a murder mystery in a haunted manor.

* Defend an outpost in a war between kingdoms.

* Track down the source of an illegal alchemical substance spreading through a city.

* And more!

### Removing the Training Wheels

The [Dungeon](../making_dungeons/index.html) model for sessions is designed with "training wheels" to help new players and GM's get used to gameplay. Notice the level of structure involved. 

* Every dungeon consists of rooms.

* Every room consists of enemies, hazards, and a description. 

* Players have a direct goal (defeat the boss).

* Players have an expectation of how to interact with the world (mostly combat).

Now look back at the example adventure scenarios at the top of this page. **They do not conform to the dungeon model**. This means that you have more freedom in how to create a session. It also means you have greater responsibilities.
