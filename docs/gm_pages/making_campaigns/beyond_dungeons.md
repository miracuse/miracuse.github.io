# Beyond Dungeons

There are a great many types of games you can run with _Miracuse_. You and your players might:

- Fight a legal battle to escape wrongful (or otherwise) imprisonment.

- Solve a murder mystery in a haunted manor.

- Defend an outpost in a war between kingdoms.

- Track down the source of an illegal alchemical substance spreading through a city.

- And more!

### Removing the Training Wheels

The [Dungeon](../making_dungeons/index.html) model for sessions is designed with "training wheels" to help new players and GM's get used to gameplay. Notice the level of structure involved.

- Every dungeon consists of rooms.

- Every room consists of enemies, hazards, and a description.

- Players have a direct goal (defeat the boss).

- Players have an expectation of how to interact with the world (mostly combat).

Now look back at the example adventure scenarios at the top of this page. **They do not conform to the dungeon model**. This means that you have more freedom in how to create a session. It also means you have greater responsibilities.

As the GM you will be responsible for ensuring that the Players have a goal to work towards. You will need to provide direction, pacing, interesting NPC's, and obstacles to progress. You were doing this before, but now the scope is a bit wider. Players can decide to go off in directions you didn't anticipate, and it will be up to you to improvise on the fly.

### Building a Wider Toolkit

You can't prepare for every eventuality, but you can build a set of tools to make improvising easier.

##### NPC Deck

> **Tip**: Don't get too attached to any of your NPC's. Players (and the dice) have a tendency to keep their lives short.

Spend some time generating a pool of characters related to the area your players are in. Start with the ones that your players are most likely to encounter; law enforcement, town mayors, barkeepers, healers, shady back alley contacts, etc. Ask yourself who holds power in the the region?

Of course, you can always improvise NPC's on the fly. And usually you'll have to (players are notorious for befriending [any character that strikes their fancy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra)). But keeping a dedicated stash of characters in your pocket will be a major help when you find yourself drawing a blank.

##### Enemy and Hazard Deck

Just as with NPC's, it can be handy to have a stack of premade challenges to deploy when your brain stalls out. If you know that your players are going to heading into demon-infested waters in the next few sessions, spend some time workshopping hell frogs, shark men, clouds of evil fog, and other threats.

You may not use all of these cards in the next session. But by slowly building a stockpile of nasty problems, you'll create a safety cushion for use in future games.

##### Room Deck

Rooms aren't just for dungeons. If your players decide to skip the local village with plot important information, it can be a good idea to direct them towards a pre-generated pit stop and present the plot hooks there instead. Doing so buys you time to adjust your game on the fly while maintaining momentum. A couple examples:

- A long-forgotten shrine to a dead god

- A crossroads with a smiling demon waiting at the corner

- A haunted battlefield
