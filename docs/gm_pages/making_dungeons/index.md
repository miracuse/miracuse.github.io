# Making Dungeons

"Dungeon" is a loose term, used here to represent any location filled with threats to the players. Though not the only kind of area in _Miracuse_, dungeons are excellent for challenging players with a direct goal and obvious danger. A handful of examples:

- A cursed temple, lousy with undead and ancient traps

- A foreboding forest, filled with hungry wolves and hazardous terrain

- A tunnel network, crawling with goblins and their improvised weapons

- A wizard's tower, protected by golems and warding spells

### The Baseline Dungeon

| Worg Cave |                                                                                                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rooms     | _Entrance Cave_, _Cursed Cave_, _Snake-infested Cave_, _Slime Cave_, _Wolf Den_, _Alpha Worg's Lair_ |
| Enemies   | Wolves, dark spirits, alpha wolves, gelatinous slimes                                                |
| Hazards   | Old bear traps, primitive curses, snake nests                                                        |
| Boss      | Elder Worg                                                                                           |

> **Tip**: It's a good idea to have more content (floors, enemies, hazards) than you think you need. If player progress is slow, you can always cut out content to ensure a timely finale.

**_Rooms_**

```
GM:  You enter a set of caves that feels darker than those above.
     Something unnatural stirs here. Roll Presence.
```

Rooms are discrete areas in a dungeon. That might mean a single cave or an entire floor depending on context. _The Wizard's Alchemical Lab_ could be a room. So could _The Hall of Cursed Mirrors_.

Rooms generally contain [enemies](making_enemies/index.html) or [hazards](making_hazards.html), sometimes both. It's a good idea to think about how you'd describe a room to a group.
