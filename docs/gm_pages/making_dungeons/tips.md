# Tips

This section contains tips and advice for making dungeons.

### How to Make a Room

The basic formula for a room is **Enemy + Hazard + Description**. Usually, figuring out one will solve the rest.

If you know you the **Enemy** is giant spiders, then you can guess that a good **Hazard** would be sticky webs. At that point, the room description writes itself.

```
GM:  You enter a room covered in thick sticky spider webs.
     Each step you take sends vibrations down the web into
     dark corners, where something seems to lurk.
```

##### Dungeon Cards

One way to prep dungeons is by brainstorming a set of **Enemies**, **Hazards**, and **Descriptions** as flash cards. Then, try fitting cards from each pool together.

> Goblins + Arrow Trap + Ancient Library

> Kobolds + Poison Gas + Warehouse

> Demons + Swarming Diseased Insects + Graveyard

##### Randomly Generated Dungeons

The internet contains plenty of resources for [improvising dungeons](https://watabou.itch.io/one-page-dungeon). Try drawing inspiration from a pre-made dungeon, using it to generate your own rooms and layout.

### Non-linear Dungeons

> **Tip**: When creating a dungeon with more than one path, be sure to draw a map for yourself (and possibly for your players). It's easy to lose track of where the players are otherwise.

The [example dungeon](index.html#an-example-dungeon) follows linearly from the top floor to increasingly deep caves. GM's are welcome to create dungeons with branching paths as well.
