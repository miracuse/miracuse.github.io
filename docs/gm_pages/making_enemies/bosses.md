# Bosses

Bosses are the big bad guys, the ones that can stand toe-to-toe with the entire Player party. These are your vampire lords, your bandit kings, your T-Rex fights.

### The Baseline Boss

| Boss (Stage 2) |                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Offense        | +3                        |
| Damage         | +1                        |
| Defense        | +1                        |
| Phy. Health    | ☐ ☐ ☐                     |
| Men. Health    | ☐ ☐                       |
| Ability        | Three turns in initiative |

All bosses have at least two stages. When they take enough damage to be incapacitated, they instead transition to the next stage. Their health boxes clear, their stats might shuffle around, and they usually gain a new ability.

In-game, you might describe this change as the boss getting angry, transforming into a bigger monster, or otherwise just behaving in a noticably different way.

Also note that bosses usually have multiple turns in initiative. This helps keep the rhythm of a fight similar to a typical skirmish.

### Too Big to Fight

Some bosses are better described as obstacles rather than enemies. A colossus standing forty feet tall exists on a scale where the Players' usual attacks aren't going to have much effect.

In those situations, **don't roll turn order**. Treat these "fights" like puzzles or environmental challenges.

| Colossus                 |       |
| ------------------------ | ----- |
| Offense                  | +1    |
| Damage                   | +2    |
| Defense                  | -     |
| Endurance                | ☐ ☐ ☐ |
| Timer: Crush the Village | ☐ ☐ ☐ |

- What would it take to chip away at this enemy's endurance? Reward Player creativity. Offer hints if they're struggling ("Roll Perception. There's a cart of gunpowder in the village armory, but you'll need to keep the colossus stalled while someone fetches it.")

- How should Players go about defending against this enemy? Signal that "blocking" will be much harder than "dodging". Maybe have the colossus be a little stupid (has a hard time finding the Players) or arrogant (consider the Players too insignificant to deal with).

- Set a timer to keep Players on their toes. What happens if they can't stop the colossus? Mark off boxes in a visible track so that Players understand the enemy's rate of progress.
