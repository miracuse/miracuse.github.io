# Making Enemies

Bad Guys are the bread-and-butter of running games. They're the main source of opposition Players will face, an "interactive obstacle" with personality. This section will provide guidelines for creating and running them.

### The Baseline "Mook"

| Mook        |      |
| ----------- | ---- |
| Offense     | +1   |
| Damage      | +1   |
| Defense     | +0   |
| Phy. Health | ☐    |
| Men. Health | ☐    |
| Ability     | None |

When it comes to combat, you don't need (or want) full-blown character sheets for each bad guy. Instead, we boil enemies down to a handful of stats.

- **Offense**: How hard this enemy is to block/dodge.

- **Damage**: How many boxes of damage this enemy does on hit.

- **Defense**: How hard this enemy is to hit.

- **Physical Health**: How many Physical boxes this enemy has.

- **Mental Health**: How many Mental boxes this enemy has.

- **Ability**: Any special abilities this enemy has.

The baseline "Mook" is a catch-all stat block for any nobody the Players are fighting. The party stumbles on to a pack of wolves? Mooks. The party is ambushed by bandits? Mooks. If there's nothing special about the opposition, they're mooks.

**_Statistics_**

> **Tip**: When it comes to ties, a handy phrase to keep in mind is "Defender Wins". A player needs to _beat_ an enemy's Defense to hit them, and _match_ an enemy's Offense to avoid harm.

From a statistics point of view, Players will hit Mooks 90% of the time. The Player rolls their Skill to attack (usually a +2). If they exceed the enemy's Defense stat, they deal a box of damage. Since Mooks only have one of those, they're instantly taken out.

Depending on a Player's class, a plain Mook will either hit 10% of the time (Soldier/Scoundrel) or 70% of the time (Alchemist/Mage). The Player rolls a Skill to avoid harm (Strength/Agility). If they roll _equal to or greater_ than the enemy's Offense, they take no damage.

**_Victory and Defeat_**

Just because an enemy runs out of health doesn't mean they've been killed. A few alternatives, depending on the kind of enemy and game being run:

- **Morale Failure**: The enemies are routed, booking a hasty retreat

- **Immobile**: The enemies are beaten up to the point that they can't move, laying on the ground while moaning and cursing

- **Removal from Location**: The enemy is hit through a window, a wall, or knocked down a pit

> **Tip**: You can apply these to incapacitated players as well.

### Building Bigger Enemies

GM's can tweak the Mook stat block to produce enemies that are more dangerous or difficult to fight. A few examples are listed below, along with suggestions for their use. The FATE SRD's [Adversary Toolkit](https://fate-srd.com/fate-adversary-toolkit/types-adversaries#enemies) can be a good reference as well.

**_Hitter_**

| Hitter      |                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| Offense     | +3                         |
| Damage      | +1                         |
| Defense     | +0                         |
| Phy. Health | ☐                          |
| Men. Health | ☐                          |
| Ability     | Attacks are area-of-effect |

- A good fit for "glass cannon" enemies, like evil wizards or snipers

- With a high offense, this enemy succeeds in dealing damage most of the time

- With low health and defense, this enemy is easy to take out

- Play around with thematically appropriate abilities in place of "area of effect" attacks

**_Tank_**

| Tank (Fast) |                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Offense     | +1                      |
| Damage      | +1                      |
| Defense     | +2                      |
| Phy. Health | ☐                       |
| Men. Health | ☐                       |
| Ability     | Prevent movement on hit |

---

| Tank (Tough) |                  |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Offense      | +1               |
| Damage       | +1               |
| Defense      | +0               |
| Phy. Health  | ☐ ☐ ☐            |
| Men. Health  | ☐                |
| Ability      | Knockdown on hit |

- A good candidate for "hard to hit" enemies (snakes, harpies) or "beefy" enemies (boars, knights)

- Low offensive power, but with an annoying effect when successful

- _Either_ hard to land a hit on _or_ with multiple health boxes, but never both
