# Making Hazards

Monsters and villains aren't the only threats adventurers need to worry about. The land itself poses serious risks to the unprepared.

### The Baseline Hazard

| Arrow Trap |                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Offense    | +1                     |
| Damage     | +1                     |
| Ability    | Hidden (+1)            |
| Trigger    | Stepping into an area. |

> **Tip:** When in doubt, default to a **Proficient (+1)** difficulty rating that does one box of damage.

A hazard is like an enemy in that it can hurt characters. It has an **Offense** stat that players need to roll against. It has a **Damage** value that determines how many boxes get marked. And like enemies, most hazards have the same stat block behind the scenes.

Arrow trap? Rockslide? Lingering curse? All of them can be modeled with the same **Proficient (+1)** difficulty. The Skill that players use to overcome the issue might vary (after all, "blocking" a rockslide is going to be harder than moving out of the way), but the fundamental concept will not.

**_Fiction First_**

Let the fiction of the environment take precedence over any stat block. Escaping from a rolling boulder is a **Proficient (+1)** Agility challenge, but stopping a boulder in its tracks is an **Expert (+3)** Strength challenge.

When in doubt, fall back on the basics of [setting difficulties](setting_difficulty_levels.html). "How hard would it be for the player to do XYZ?"

### Solving Hazards

> **Tip**: If you can solve the problem by beating it up, it's an [enemy](making_enemies/index.html), not a hazard.

Solving hazards usually involves some amount of player ingenuity. Characters can attempt to "brute force" a hazard by charging through them, but there are generally better ways. Traps can be disarmed. Curses can be dispelled. Be sure to reward player creativity in coming up with innovative ways around a hazard. Try to avoid "puzzles" that have only one possible solution.

### Passive Hazards

| Climbing a Cliff |                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Offense          | +1               |
| Damage           | +1               |
| Ability          | None             |
| Trigger          | Trying to climb. |

Not all hazards are outright dangerous. Something as straightforward as "climbing a cliff" can be a hazard.

In this scenario, a player that fails the roll can still succeed in climbing the cliff. They simply incur a cost in the form of damage. See [success at a cost](setting_difficulty_levels.html#advanced-approaches) for more details.
