# Scenario Design

Scenarios are the individual adventures that players go on. From the GM perspective, they include plot, places, and people. For example:

    Climbing a cursed mountain to seal away the monster on top

    **Plot**: A powerful monster is loose, leaving behind a valuable treasure at the shrine where it was imprisoned

    **Places**: A lodge at the mountain base, a spooky mountainside, a network of dark caves, the mountain summit

    **People**: Monsters, wildlife, a hermit or some bandits living on the mountain
