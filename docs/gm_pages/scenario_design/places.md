# Places: The “Where”

Places are exactly what they sound like. They represent the locations that adventures take place. Many also include Obstacles and Hazards.

- **Obstacles** are passive problems that block the players’ progress (a cliff, a fast running river, etc.)

- **Hazards** are active problems in an area that may cause harm to characters (a forest fire, a cloud of poisonous gas, etc.)
