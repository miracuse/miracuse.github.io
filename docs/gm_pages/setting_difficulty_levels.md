# Setting Difficulty Levels

Part of the learning curve in running sessions is learning to "eyeball" the difficulty of various tasks. How hard should it be to climb a steep cliff? Or to cast a spell? GM's will become more skilled at making estimates on the fly as they run more sessions, but it can be hard starting out. This section provides advice and tips to make the process easier.


### Use the Ladder 

{% include skill_ladder.html %}

With any task, ask yourself where it falls on the Skill Ladder. Is this something that you think a **Proficient (+1)** person could manage? Or would you have to be a **Professional (+2)** to pull it off?

* **Mediocre (+0):** Climbing a one-story building with a ladder. Usually so easy that the GM won't even call for a roll.

* **Proficient (+1):** Climbing a one-story building without a ladder. A normal person could do this, but it isn't easy.

* **Professional (+2):** Climbing a tall building without a ladder. Best done by someone with specialized training.

* **Expert (+3):** Climbing a castle wall that's built to keep people out. Impossible for a normal person, but feasible for an infiltration expert.

* **Master (+4):** Climbing a slick frost-covered castle wall. Only the best infiltration experts could manage something this difficult.

* **Olympian (+5):** Climbing a slick frost-covered castle wall while carrying a person. A heroic effort that will inspire legends and songs.


### Baseline Difficulty

With many tasks, you're safe using a baseline difficulty of **Proficient (+1)**. Statistically, this means that:

1. Someone with a +2 in the matching Skill will have a 90% chance of success

2. Someone with a +0 in the matching Skill will have a 30% chance of success

Players are rewarded for working towards their characters' strengths, while those rolling without a Skill understand that success is a risky proposition. 


### Narrative Context

The difficulty of tasks depend on context. Swimming across a river could be a **Proficient (+1)** task, but doing it in metal armor is easily a **Professional (+2)** task. Don't be afraid to adjust the threshold up or down according to the context of the situation.

Likewise, in situations where conditions are unusually favorable, make use of Advantage. You might use Advantage to reward a Player that pulls out climbing gear when scaling a cliffside, or to empower a Mage that's drawing energy off a magical crystal they found.


### Advanced Approaches

***Success at a Cost***

In situations where failure would be boring, have the Player succeed but pay a price.

Returning to our climbing example, the other Players don't want to wait while the Mage rerolls Agility to get over the top of a building. Instead, have the Mage successfully reach the top, but mark a Physical box to reflect the exhaustion of doing so. It's worth noting here that "cost" can mean any of a player's resources:

* Physical/Mental Health

* Charge/Fortune/Mana/Prep Points

* Temporarily Lose Access to a Kit (consider rolling a 1d4 to determine which)
