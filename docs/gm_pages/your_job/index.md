# Your Job

1. **_Set the Scene_**

2. **_Judge the Rules_**

3. **_Keep Things Interesting_**

### Set the Scene

A healthy portion of your job is simply to **Set the Scene**. Tell the players where they are, highlighting anything or anyone of interest. Paint a picture of their surroundings, and then step aside. The Players will [help with the heavy lifting](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/what-do-during-play#aspects-and-details-discovery-vs.-creation) of creating a scene by reacting to the picture you paint.

Say your players are fighting some goblins:

> GM: You're in a clearing outside of a cave. Three goblins, armed with knives and clubs, start circling around you.
>
> Player 1: Is there anything flammable around them?
>
> GM: The tall grass in the clearing could probably be set on fire, if you have a way to do that.
>
> Player 1: I've got the _Spirit of Fire_ Kit, so I'll throw some flame under one of the goblins.

Notice how little information the GM needed to give before the Player started taking action. A location and an active problem is all it takes most of the time. After you've laid those out, step back, and _react_ to the players' actions.

### Judge the Rules

Another major component of GM'ing is **Judging the Rules**. This is where you decide what's allowed, how difficult a task is, and so on.

Sometimes there are clear-cut mechanics in place. For example, the rules for combat state that you take one point of Physical damage if you fail to defend against an attack. A character or [enemy](../making_enemies/index.md) with the right Kit might increase that to two damage, or cause Mental damage rather than Physical. The threshold for success will depend on the NPC's stats.

Other scenarios won't have the same level of specific guidance. If a Player decides to talk down a group of bandits, you'll need to decide what roll is necessary to succeed. For that, we rely on the Skill Ladder.

When you set the difficulty of a task, ask yourself: is this something a person _Proficient_ in the Skill could do? What about someone who was _Trained_ in this kind of task? Would it take an _Expert_ or a _Master_ to pull off? Keep in mind that a Player Character with +2 in a Skill has a [70% chance](../../additional_resources/system_design/statistics.md) of getting a +2 or better when rolling.

### Keep Things Interesting

The final piece of advice I have to offer is to **Keep Things Interesting**.

In any game, it's likely that the pacing will slow at some point. Maybe the Players aren't sure what to do next. Maybe a fight has become a slog, or they're trying to haggle over the purchase of magic items.

_Miracuse_ is designed to avoid these scenarios as best as possible, but there's no way to fully prevent a lag in pacing. Your role is to recognize when the Players stumble into one of these slumps and take action to get them out.
