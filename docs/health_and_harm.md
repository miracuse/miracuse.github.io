# Health and Harm

Danger is a constant of any adventure. Throughout the course of their career, characters are guarenteed to find themselves in harm's way. When this happens, the GM will tell you to mark **Damage**. 

| Damage Track |         |         |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- |
| Physical     | &#9745; | &#9744; |
| Mental       | &#9744; | &#9744; |


Unless specifically stated damage is assumed to be Physical. It has little effect on its own, but players that go over the amount of damage they can handle will be Incapacitated and Injured.

* **Incapacitated** characters cannot act until their damage track is completely clear.

* **Injured** characters will roll on one of the two tables below. Until treated, future rolls they make that could reasonably be impacted by their injury will take a -1 penalty.

| Ten-Sided Die | Physical         | Mental    |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| 1             | Damaged Foot     | Dazed     |
| 2             | Damaged Knee     | Migraine  |
| 3             | Damaged Groin    | Confused  |
| 4             | Damaged Back     | Exhausted |
| 5             | Damaged Ribs     | Manic     |
| 6             | Damaged Hand     | Shaken    |
| 7             | Damaged Shoulder | Stirred   |
| 8             | Damaged Neck     | Gibbering |
| 9             | Damaged Face     | Lifeless  |
| 10            | Damaged Eyes     | Wrathful  |

### Recovery

Both damage and injuries are cleared after resting at camp overnight. Damage can also be recovered using certain Kits.

Some injuries may have additional requirements to remove. These represent special circumstances, such as being poisoned or cursed. The GM will offer advice on how to 
seek treatment.
