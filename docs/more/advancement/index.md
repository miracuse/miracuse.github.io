# Advancement

Not Yet Implemented
{: .label .label-red }

Characters will gradually become more skilled as Players use them over several sessions. This is reflected in their **Skill Points** and **Tier**.

---

### Skill Points

| Skill Level Upgrade | Skill Point Cost |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| 0 -> 1              | 1                |
| 1 -> 2              | 2                |
| 2 -> 3              | 3                |
| 3 -> 4              | 4                |

At the end of every session, Players are awarded a **Skill Point**. These can be used to upgrade a Character's Skills. Higher level Skills take more points to upgrade.

### Tiers

| Tier | Number of Specializations | Approx. Number of Skill Points |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1    | 1                         | 0                              |
| 2    | 2                         | 10                             |
| 3    | 3                         | 20                             |
| 4    | 4                         | 30                             |

A Character's **Tier** represents a larger increase in power. Tier increases are generally awarded after Players have completed a significant milestone in-game, such as completing a major arc of a campaign. As a rule of thumb, a tier increase happens roughly every 10 sessions, though this is dependent on GM discretion.

Each Tier allows a Player to select an additional specialization from any Class. This gives their Character six new Kits to choose from when [Making Camp](../../adventuring/exploration/index.md). The overall limit of equipping four Kits remains unchanged.
