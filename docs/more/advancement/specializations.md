# Specializations

Not Yet Implemented
{: .label .label-red }

>**Tip**: Make sure that your character has the right skills to use kits they acquire. Gaining access to Talismans won't be very helpful if your character has no points in the Magic skill.

When a character moves up a [Tier](../advancement/index.html#tier) they acquire another specialization, giving them access to six more kits. Specializations can be chosen from any of the sets available to new characters, including those outside of their starting class.

***Advanced Specializations***

Some specializations exist outside the four classes. These can't be taken during character creation, but can be acquired after advancing to a new tier.

### Example: Templar

**Templars** are often affiliated with a Knight Order, but may not be knights themselves. They make use of Weapons, Alchemy, and Talismans specialized for combatting hostile magic. Many Nations and Temples make use of their services to track down rogue practitioners.
