# Specializations

Not Yet Implemented
{: .label .label-red }

>**Tip**: Make sure that your character has the right skills to use kits they acquire. Gaining access to Talismans won't be very helpful if your character has no points in the Magic skill.

When a character moves up a [Tier](../advancement/index.html#tier) they acquire another specialization, giving them access to six more kits. Specializations can be chosen from any of the sets available to new characters, including those outside of their starting class.

##### Advanced Specializations

**Advanced Specializations** are those that aren't associated with a class. Though typically taken when a character reaches a higher tier, players using a [Custom Class](../custom_class.html) can choose them at Tier 1.

> **Note**: Advanced Specializations are not stronger than the others. Rather, they include kits across a broader range of Skills, making them well-suited for higher tier characters with more [Skill Points](../more/advancement/index.html).

### Example: Templar

**Templars** are often affiliated with a Knight Order, but may not be knights themselves. They make use of Weapons, Alchemy, and Talismans specialized for combatting hostile magic. Many Nations and Temples make use of their services to track down rogue practitioners.
