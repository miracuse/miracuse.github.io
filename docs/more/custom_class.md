# Custom Classes

> **Tip**: Custom Classes require a good understanding of the system to build and use properly. Be sure you're familiar with _Miracuse_ before proceeding.

**Custom Classes** allow players more flexibility in creating their characters. Players can explore combinations of [Skills](../gameplay/skills.html) and [Kits](../gameplay/kits.html) outside of what the four base classes provide.

### Creating a Custom Class

The process for creating a custom class is not much different from using the base classes.

- Choose any [Specialization](../more/specializations/index.html)

- Choose one of the following Skill spreads and adjust your character accordingly.

  - Standard (Any Two Skills at +2)
  - Versatile (Any One Skill at +2, Any Three Skills at +1)

> **<span style="color: red">Warning:</span>** Make sure that your character has the proper Skills to use their kits. If you take a specialization that consists mainly of Talisman kits, you should have at least one point in Magic.

> **Note:** Despite the name, [Advanced Specializations](../more/advancement/specializations.html) aren't any more powerful than other specializations. They do tend to involve multiple Kit types though, and may be harder to use for characters with few [Skill Points](../more/advancement/index.html).

### Example: **<span style="color: {{ site.paladin_color }}">The Paladin</span>**

**Specialization**

- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Priest</span>**

**Skills**

- **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>** +2
- **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Bravery</span>** +1
- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** +1
- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>** +1

**Description**

A holy knight trained in the arts of war and magic. **<span style="color: {{ site.paladin_color }}">Paladins</span>** are less capable at spellcasting than Mages, but gain a great deal of versatility from their access to Talismans. Likewise, **<span style="color: {{ site.paladin_color }}">Paladins</span>** have none of the Weapons of a **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Soldier</span>**, but have similar durability, a small pool of Fortune, and high **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>**.
