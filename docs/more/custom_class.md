# Custom Classes

> **Tip**: Custom Classes require a good understanding of the _Miracuse_ system to build and use properly. Be sure you're comfortable with the game's mechanics before proceeding.

**Custom Classes** allow players more flexibility in creating their characters. Players can explore combinations of [Skills](../gameplay/skills.html) and [Kits](../gameplay/kits.html) outside of what the four base classes provide.

---

### Creating a Custom Class

The process for creating a custom class is similar to that of using the base classes.

- **(Kits)** Choose any [Specialization](../more/specializations/index.html). 

- **(Skills)** Choose one of the following Skill spreads and adjust your character sheet accordingly.

  - Standard (Any Two Skills at +2)
  - Versatile (Any One Skill at +2, Any Three Skills at +1)

> **<span style="color: red">Warning:</span>** Make sure that your character has the proper Skills to use their kits. For example, if you take a specialization that consists mainly of Talisman kits, you should have at least a +1 in Magic.

##### Advanced Specializations

Despite the name, [Advanced Specializations](../more/advancement/specializations.html) aren't any more powerful than other specializations. They do tend to involve multiple Kit types though, and may be harder to use for new characters with few [Skill Points](../more/advancement/index.html) to spare.

### Example: **<span style="color: {{ site.paladin_color }}">The Paladin</span>**

> **Specialization**: **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Priest</span>**
>
>**Skills**
>
>- **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>** +2
>- **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Bravery</span>** +1
>- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** +1
>- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>** +1

**Description**

A holy knight trained in the arts of war and magic. **<span style="color: {{ site.paladin_color }}">Paladins</span>** have access to [Priest](../more/specializations/priest.html) kits, but aren't as good at spellcasting when compared to a full-fledged **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Mage</span>**. Similarly, they have none of the Weapon kits of a **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Soldier</span>**, but possess similar durability and **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Strength</span>**.

### Example: **<span style="color: {{ site.warlock_color }}">The Warlock</span>**

> **Specialization**: **<span style="color: {{ site.warlock_color }}">Conjurer</span>**
>
>**Skills**
>
>- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>** +2
>- **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** +1
>- **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>** +1
>- **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Cunning</span>** +1

**Description**

A dabbler in [illegal magic](../more/specializations/conjurer.html), on the run from [Templars](../more/specializations/templar.html) and other law enforcement. **<span style="color: {{ site.warlock_color }}">Warlocks</span>** rely on a combination of spells, alchemy, and deceit to avoid capture.

### Example: **<span style="color: {{ site.myrmidon_color }}">The Myrmidon</span>**

> **Specialization**: **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Blademaster</span>**
>
>**Skills**

>- **<span style="color: {{ site.soldier_color }}">Bravery</span>** +2
>- **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>** +2

**Description**

A swordsman that focuses on speed over strength. Though less hardy than others, their ability to deliver a killing blow before enemies can draw their weapons makes defense irrelevant.
