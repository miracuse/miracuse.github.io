# Skill Substitution

    Player: I want to use Spirit of Wood to grow some plants that grab
            the bandits' feet and trip them up.

    GM:     Okay, roll Magic.

    Player: Uh, I don't have any points in that.

    GM:     Do you want to spend a Prep Point to use Cunning instead?

_Spirit_ and _Alchemy_ Kits require the Magic and Knowledge Skills, respectively, to be used effectively. Players can substitute those Skills for a single use by spending a resource point.

### Resource to Skill Mapping

| Mana Point    | Magic or Presence       |
| Prep Point    | Cunning or Agility      |
