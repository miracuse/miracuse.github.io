A scholar and archaeologist studying fragments of a fallen empire. They tend to be **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledgeable</span>** and dabble in alchemy.

Earlier civilizations were said to use a technology distinct from modern magic and alchemy. Sigils, geometric fractal designs holding unknown power, were worked into many of their products. Protective clothing might have a sigil stitched into it, while fine tools and weapons were regularly engraved. The more complex and large the sigil, the greater its power was, but also the faster it was to deteriorate.

Though the art of permanent sigils has been lost to time, Antiquarians have found success in drawing temporary sigils with an alchemic paint. Objects with a sigil gain a little of its power for a brief time.
