Expert infiltrators proficient in the use of poisons. Their weapon of choice are “thorns”, small needles that can be discretely thrown or attached to the ends of arrows.

Though not formally organized under a guild, Assassins tend to operate in a loose network of criminal organizations. They rarely remain on the payroll of a patron for long. One of their strongest assets is having little relation with a client, so that the repercussions of a failed job are constrained to the Assassin's death, rather than sparking a war.

Assassins occasionally find employ with [Fell Knights](fell_knight.html) to track down notorious criminals and renegade [Conjurers](conjurer.html). Others choose to work as simple thieves, stealing trade secrets or important documents.
