> Scoundrel Specialization

Members of a courierâ€™s guild, trained in a little magic, a little stage alchemy, and the art of throwing knives. Bards are frequently employed as messengers, entertainers, spies, and legal consul. Their social position is nebulous enough that they can comfortably interact with aristocrats and peasants.
