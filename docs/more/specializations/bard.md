A member of a courierâ€™s guild, trained in etiquette and self-defense. Bards are frequently employed as messengers, entertainers, and spies. They compete with the [Witches](witch.html) Guild for postal work.

Bards are masters of "stagecraft", a discipline which blends illusion Talismans and flashy alchemy together to astonishing effect. Their strong oratory skills and acrobatic talents make them peerless performers. They find a ready welcome wherever they go, and are often the main source of news for small villages.
