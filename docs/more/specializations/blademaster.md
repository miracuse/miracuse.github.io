Recognized masters of the sword, in great demand across the world as mercenaries and bodyguards. Often retained by nobility as professional duelists to settle personal disputes.

While formidable fighters, a Blademaster's true claim to fame are their magic swords. Precise instruments rather than simple weapons for violence, tools that require years of practice to use correctly. A skilled Blademaster can switch from one blade to the next in the same motion.

Tradition dictates that all [Blademasters](blademaster.html) do their training outside the safety of cities. It's common for Nation-born students to live among [The Tribes](../the_world.html).
