A political combatant, trained in charm and minor alchemies. 

Chevaliers are often second- or third-generation [Knights](knight.html) who have chosen the courts as their battlefield. They prefer intrigue over monster-slaying, weaving careful plots to secure favor and diminish their enemies' standing

Despite their foppish appearances, most are formidable fighters. Chevaliers regularly compete with [Blademasters](blademaster.html) in tournaments and formal duels. What they lack in raw strength they make up for with speed, mind games, and trickery.
