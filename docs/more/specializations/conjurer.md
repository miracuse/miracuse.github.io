The [Priest's](../specializations/priest.html) antithesis, a Mage with no qualms about maintaining the boundaries between worlds. The Conjurer bargains with demons, fey, and jinn to achieve their aims.

Though not explicitly evil, Conjurers have a tendency to summon monsters that they can't put down. The frequency and severity of such disasters is high enough to warrant a blanket ban on the practice. [Templars](templar.html) in particular specialize in hunting violators down.
