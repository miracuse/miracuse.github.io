> Advanced Specialization

The [Priest's](../specializations/priest.html) antithesis, a Mage with no qualms about maintaining the boundaries between worlds. The Conjurer bargains with demons, fey, and jinn to achieve their aims. Though not explicitly evil, Conjurers are treated as such, and find themselves regularly hunted. Those that aren't slain by hunters have a tendency to summon monsters that they can't put down, and wind up dead all the same.
