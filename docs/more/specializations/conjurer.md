The [Priest's](../specializations/priest.html) antithesis, a Mage with no qualms about maintaining the boundaries between worlds. The Conjurer bargains with demons, fey, and jinn to achieve their aims. Though not explicitly evil, Conjurers have a tendency to summon monsters that they can't put down, leading to widespread destruction. [Templars](templar.html) specialize in hunting them down.
