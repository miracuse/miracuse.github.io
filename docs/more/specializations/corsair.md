> _Agility, Cunning_

An experienced sailor of the seas and skies. The Corsair moves with unmatched **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>**, sprinting along rigging and jumping between ships.

Though a common trade among pirates, Corsairs are just as often employed as a countermeasure to banditry. Their presence is enough to warn off most aspiring sky pirates and brigands. Unlike [Knights](knight.html) and [Legionnaires](legionnaire.html), Corsairs keep a light pack. Their main weapons are the _Bloody Cutlass_ and _Marauder Flintlock_.

Corsairs are generally not proficient spellcasters, but even the least magical among their number offers prayers to sea and sky spirits. The minor spells they're able to cast can mean the difference between washing up on shore or a watery grave.
