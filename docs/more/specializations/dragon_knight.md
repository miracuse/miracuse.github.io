A knight that uses ancient medicines to transform their body.

Dragon Knights belong to an ancient [Knight Order](../the_world.html#the-knight-orders) of the same name. By tradition, members are recruited from settlements that have been destroyed by a dragon or one of its spawn. Their fierce desire for revenge gives them the strength to endure brutal training and body altering drugs. Those that survive become ideal dragon slayers.
