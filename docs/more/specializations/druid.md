> Advanced Specialization

Practitioners of one of the oldest magic traditions in existence. The teachings of Druids are never committed to writing. Instead, they are recited from master to student in holy caves, sacred groves, and beside ancient menhirs. They're said to revel in the light of the new moon each month, to practice human sacrifice, and to never age. Though the truth of these rumors is in dispute, the air of mystery surrounding their discipline leads many to treat them with great caution.
