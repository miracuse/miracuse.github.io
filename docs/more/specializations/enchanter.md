> Alchemist Specialization

Esoteric philosophers seeking to unify alchemy and magic by creating life. Though enchanted weapons are typically the result of magecraft, "Enchanters" are a branch of Alchemists that borrow from magical traditions to create animated servants. None have so far succeeded in making a living creature, but their failed experiments show remarkable promise as adventuring tools. Their Mage counterparts are the [Wizards](wizard.html).
