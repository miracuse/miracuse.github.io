> Advanced Specialization

A member of a controversial [Knight Order](../the_world.html#knight-order) that believes in using any means necessary to resolve conflicts. Unlike traditional [Knights](knight.html), Fell Knights will leverage poison, fear, and underhanded tactics to ensure that warfare remains as brief as possible. Despite their ideals, Fell Knights are generally thought of as violent mercenaries masquerading as proper Knights.
