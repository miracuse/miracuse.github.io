A member of a controversial [Knight Order](../the_world.html#the-knight-orders) that believes in using any means necessary to resolve conflicts.

Unlike traditional [Knights](knight.html), Fell Knights will leverage poison, fear, and underhanded tactics to ensure that warfare remains as brief as possible. Many hold a strong conviction that terrible means are acceptable to prevent worse ends.
