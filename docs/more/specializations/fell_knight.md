> Advanced Specialization

A member of a controversial [Knight](../specializations/knight.md) Order that believes in using any means necessary to resolve conflicts. Unlike their noble counterparts, Fell Knights leverage poison, fear, and underhanded tactics to ensure that warfare will remain as brief as possible. Their signature weapons are the Mournblades, cursed swords with demons sealed inside that funnel the power of defeated enemies into the user.
