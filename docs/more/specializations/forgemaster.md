> Advanced Specialization

> _Strength, Knowledge, Magic_

An expert smith that uses alchemy and magic to shape objects from metal.

The weapons that [Blademasters](blademaster.html) and [Legionnaires](legionnaire.html) wield are crafted by Forgemasters with decades of experience. Less militant artisans might design priceless jewelry, city aqueducts, or ornate works of art. 

Though their practice predates modern [Guilds](../the_world/index.html), the Forgemasters are affiliated members, and follow in the tradition of sending journeyman to travel the world.
