> Advanced Specialization

A distant cousin to the [Sapper](../specializations/sapper.md) and fellow firearm specialist. Gunslingers eschew grenades and complex alchemy to focus on gunplay. They tend to rely on Agility rather than Perception, weaving between attacks and shooting from the hip. Their talent for skirmishing makes them ideal bodyguards.
