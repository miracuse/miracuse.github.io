> Advanced Specialization

> _Agility_

A firearm user that specializes in shoot-outs. Their lightning reflexes and trick bullets make them ideal for skirmishes.

Distant cousin to the [Sapper](../specializations/sapper.md), Gunslingers eschew grenades and complex alchemy to focus on gunplay. They rely on **<span style="color: {{ site.scoundrel_color }}">Agility</span>** rather than **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Perception</span>**, preferring to shoot from the hip and weave between bullets. Many find work as bodyguards or mercenaries.
