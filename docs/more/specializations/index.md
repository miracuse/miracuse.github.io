# Specializations

**Specializations** are groups of six [kits](../../gameplay/kits.html) that determine what special equipment a character has access to. [Priests](priest.html) have talismans that let them work divine magic, [Assassins](assassin.html) have poisoned needles, and so on.

From a narrative perspective, a Specialization reflects a character's trade and training. They represent equipment that may have taken years to master. Although anyone might pickup a [Knight's](knight.html) *Holy Sword*, it takes an experienced wielder to bring out the sword's true potential.
