# Specializations

**Specializations** reflect a trade or profession that a character has mastered. They consist of six kits related to the profession. [Priests](priest.html) have talismans that let them work divine magic, [Assassins](assassin.html) have poisoned needles, [Blademasters](blademaster.html) have magic swords, and so on.
