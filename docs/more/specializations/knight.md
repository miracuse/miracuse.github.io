> Soldier Specialization

A warrior sworn to uphold a code of honor. Knights are recognized by their _Holy Sword_, but are trained with a variety of weapons and tools. They serve as the frontline of defense against monsters, demons, and renegade mages. Knighthood orders are held in high esteem, and are empowered to act as civil officials in times of need.
