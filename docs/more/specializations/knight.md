> _Strength, Bravery_

A warrior sworn to uphold a code of honor. Knights are recognized by their _Holy Sword_, but are trained with a variety of weapons and tools.

Knights serve as the frontline of defense against monsters, demons, and renegade mages. [Knight Orders](../the_world.html) are held in high esteem, and their members are empowered to act as civil officials in times of need. Distinguished Knights are often awarded frontier estates and titles by [The Nations](../the_world.html) as a means of encouraging them to settle dangerous land.
