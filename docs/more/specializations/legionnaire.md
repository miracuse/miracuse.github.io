> Soldier Specialization

Part combatant, part laborer, the Legionnaire is an infantryman with alchemically-enhanced equipment. They're well known for being deployed to create public infrastructure in hazardous areas.

A Legionnaire's gear strongly resembles standard issue for [The Lost Empire](../the_world.html) but with a number of alchemical enhancements. Their weapons are deadlier, their shields more portable, and each soldier is outfitted with a supply of portable cement for use in construction work.
