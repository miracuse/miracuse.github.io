> Soldier Specialization

Part combatant, part laborer, the Legionnaire is an experiment in enhancing traditional infantry with alchemy. Their equipment strongly resembles standard issue gear, but a series of modifications sets their capability well above basic spears and shields. Legionnaires are often distinguished by their skill in construction, able to leverage a portable alchemical cement to build bridges, roads, and encampments while on the march.
