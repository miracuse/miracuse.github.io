> Soldier Specialization

Part combatant, part laborer, the Legionnaire is a traditional infantryman with alchemically-enhanced equipment. Their gear strongly resembles standard issue equipment, but with a series of modifications to improve their effectiveness. Legionnaires are often distinguished by their skill in construction, able to leverage a portable alchemical cement to build bridges, roads, and encampments while on the march.
