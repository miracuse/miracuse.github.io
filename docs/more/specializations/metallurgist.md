> Advanced Specialization

A master smith with a deep connection to metal. Metallurgists employ a form of advanced alchemy that overlaps with magecraft, reshaping and transmuting metals through the use of carefully constructed rings. Though this practice resembles **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>**, it's founded in the user's **<span style="color: {{ site.alchemist_color }}">Knowledge</span>** rather than their relationship with the spirits.
