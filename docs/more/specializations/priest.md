> Mage Specialization

Priests arbitrate the boundaries between worlds. They govern over the living and the dead, the worldly and the otherworldly. Priests hold political positions in many countries as magistrates and court magicians. While not inherently more wise or noble than others, a Priest's power over the supernatural is generally considered merit enough to hold office.
