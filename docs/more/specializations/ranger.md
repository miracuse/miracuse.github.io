A warrior trained in the traditions of the [The Tribe](../the_world.html). They carry twin axes and a silent hunting bow.

Rangers are fleet-footed warriors with an affinity for the natural world. Their ability to control wildlife makes them highly sought after as guides and monster hunters. Those with a strong talent for magic are more likely to become [Druids](druid.html), but Rangers are capable of working minor healing and plant spells.
