Military Alchemists that specialize in munitions. Sappers are deadly sharpshooters that weaponize powerful explosives. 

Sappers have played a large part in checking the role of Mages on the battlefield in recent years. Their grenades and modified ammunition rival the destructive power of [Shamans](shaman.html). Unlike [Gunslingers](gunslinger.html), Sappers prefer to stay out of the fray by sniping from a distance.
