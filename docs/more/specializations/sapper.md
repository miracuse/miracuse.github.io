> Alchemist Specialization

Military Alchemists that specialize in munitions. Sappers have played a large part in checking the traditional role of Mages on the battlefield in recent years. Their grenades and sharpshooting rival the destructive power of [Shamans](shaman.html). Unlike [Gunslingers](gunslinger.html), Sappers prefer to stay out of the fray by sniping from a distance.
