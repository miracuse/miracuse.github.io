> Mage Specialization

Shamans are magic practitioners with dominion over the elements. Called "Battlemages" for their raw destructive potential, many Shamans are trained to tear the ground asunder and lob fireballs at enemy lines. They've occupied a central role in military forces for centuries and have only recently been matched by Alchemist [Sappers](sapper.html). Shamans with a scholarly inclination, though less common, seek to understand the world through the relationships between fire, earth, water, and air.
