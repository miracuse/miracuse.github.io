Shamans are magic practitioners with dominion over the four elements; fire, earth, air, and water.

Called "Battlemages" for their raw destructive potential, Shamans are trained to tear the ground asunder and lob fireballs at enemy lines. They've occupied a central role in military forces for centuries and have only recently been matched by [Sappers](sapper.html).

Prior to the fall of [The Lost Empire](../the_world.html), Shamans held a more spiritual role. They sought to understand the world through relationships between elements in a fashion similar to modern alchemy. Over time [The Nations](../the_world.html) came to see Shamans as valuable assets on the battlefield. Spiritual duties were relegated to [Priests](priest.html) while widespread Shaman training institutions were established to hone combat skills.
