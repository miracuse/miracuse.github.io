> Advanced Specialization

A practitioner of an unusually physical form of magic. While most Mages avoid melee combat, the Spellsword thrives on it. Their Talismans often take the form of tattoos that channel magic directly into the body. This results in greatly restricted range and a capacity for accidental self-injury, but also exceedingly powerful and versatile effects. Spellswords are most commonly found at [Knight Orders](../the_world.html#the-knight-orders).
