A practitioner of physical enhancement magic. Most take up the trade because their **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Magic</span>** and **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>** are too weak to serve as [Priests](priest.html) or [Shamans](shaman.html).

Spellsword Talismans often take the form of tattoos that channel magic directly into the body. The resulting spells have a greatly restricted range, but also provide major advantages in close combat. Excessive use has been known to take a toll on the body, leading many practitioners to emphasize physical fitness in their training.

Spellswords are most commonly found at [Knight Orders](../the_world.html#the-knight-orders) as professional monster hunters. Elsewhere they face a strong stigma for their monstrous physical abilities.
