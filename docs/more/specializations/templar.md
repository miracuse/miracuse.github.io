> Advanced Specialization

A Templar's arsenal consists of tools dedicated to countering and neutralizing dark magic. They're frequently employed to hunt down [Conjurers](conjurer.html) and other renegades before one of the creatures they summon gets loose and harms others. Many are members of a [Knight Order](../the_world.html#the-knight-orders), though plenty find employment as bounty hunters.
