A Templar's arsenal consists of tools dedicated to countering and neutralizing dark magic.

Templars are frequently employed to hunt down [Conjurers](conjurer.html) the creatures they summon get loose and harm others. Many are members of a [Knight Order](../the_world.html#the-knight-orders), though plenty find employment as bounty hunters.
