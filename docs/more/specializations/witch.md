A member of an all-female courier's guild, and rival to the [Bards](bard.html).

Witches are best known for their flying "brooms", staves of wood that use the same design principles as airships to soar through the air. Much like horse jockeys, ideal riders have small statures to maximize the speed of deliveries and number of packages being conveyed. Time-sensitive letters are sent exclusively through Witches and at great expense.

As individuals, they specialize in using **<span style="color: {{ site.mage_color }}">Presence</span>** to beguile and hypnotize others. Their equipment reinforces persuasion and escape at the expense of offensive capacity. Though some have a knack for magic, few possess the talent to qualify as Mages, and instead dedicate their limited abilities towards arts that aid in the repair of their broom.
