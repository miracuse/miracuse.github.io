> Mage Specialization

A recent historical development, Wizards manipulate fundamental energies like motion and heat by drawing inspiration from the practice of alchemy. They tend to be at odds with more traditional [Shamans](shaman.html) and [Priests](priest.html), treating spirits as things to be measured rather than worshipped. Most carry a "spellbook" filled with observation records of their experiments. Their Alchemist counterparts are the [Enchanters](enchanter.html).
