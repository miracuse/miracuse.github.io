> _Magic, Presence_

An eccentric magician that takes inspiration from alchemy. Their Talismans manipulate fundamental energies like motion and heat.

A recent historical development, Wizards see the world in terms of energy rather than elements or spirits. Their perspective tends to be at odds with more traditional [Shamans](shaman.html) and [Priests](priest.html), treating magic as something to be measured rather than worshipped. Most carry a "spellbook" filled with observation records of their experiments. Their Alchemist counterparts are the [Enchanters](enchanter.html).
