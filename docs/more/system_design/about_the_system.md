# About the System

_Miracuse_ is a Tabletop Role Playing Game designed for fast-paced, creative dungeon crawling. 

* **Simple Mechanics**: Spend less time looking up rules and more time gaming. Everything uses the same [single-roll dice system](../../gameplay/skills.md), in or out of combat.

* **Be Good At Your Job**: Don't let the dice decide everything. Skill outweighs luck in _Miracuse_, ensuring that your sneaky assassin won't be tripping alarms just because of a bad roll.

* **Participate**: No more "Face" characters or "White Mages". Every class has the capacity to contribute in combat, in social encounters, and in exploration.

* **Momentum**: Make the best of your sessions! Avoid long slogs through combat, shopping trips, and spell preparation. Gameplay built for action-packed adventuring.

### What kind of games is Miracuse intended to run?

_Miracuse_ is built for use as a streamlined dungeon crawler with an emphasis on creativity, competency, and simplicity.

Players should be able to create a character quickly and easily. At a glance, it's apparent what a character is good at (Skills) and what special abilities they have (Kits). The number of both is restricted so that players and GM's can easily keep track of capabilities.

Gameplay is likewise designed to be intuitive. There are no complex calculations to determine whether or not an attack hits or how much damage is dealt. Magic and abilities are open-ended, with wording that encourages exploration rather than prescribing specific outcomes. 

And most importantly, the narrative of a session is driven predominately by the intentions of the players. The impact of luck on any given action is less than the impact of character skill. Strong characters will usually succeed in being strong, magical characters will usually succeed in doing magic, and so on.

All of these aspects tie together to produce a game that encourages daring deeds and clever problem solving.

### Comparisons

***D&D / Pathfinder***

_Miracuse_ is less tactical and mechanics-based than its older cousins. Player's won't be tracking inventories, hit points, or bonuses to attack.

The lower complexity of the system can be a turn-off for players with a particular interest in optimization. They may, however, enjoy the new challenges inherent to this system, such as planning particular Kit/Class combinations. 

***FATE***

_Miracuse_ is a little more mechanically-driven than FATE but retains a similar philosophy towards gameplay. While you won't be working with Aspects and Stunts, you will have similar Skill and Health systems. GM's should find that the Gold and Silver rules of FATE undergird this system as well.

***Dungeon World***

_Miracuse_ borrows from Dungeon World's concepts. The simplified character creation system and purposefully limited character ability sets (Kits) were both inspired by Dungeon World. 

***OSR***

_Miracuse_ occupies an adjacent genre to OSR (Old School Renaissance) games in that it generally focuses on dungeon crawling and resource utilization. However, it trends closer to modern TTRPG's in power level, eschewing the survival aspect of OSR for pulp action gameplay.
