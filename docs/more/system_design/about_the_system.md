# About the System

_Miracuse_ is a Tabletop Role Playing Game designed for fast-paced, creative dungeon crawling. 

* **Simple Mechanics**: Spend less time calculating and more time gaming. Everything uses the same 1d10 + Skill dice system, in or out of combat.

* **Creative Gameplay**: No more page-long ability descriptions. Decide your own applications using open-ended kits that allow characters to create fire or cut through metal with swords.

* **Be Good At Your Job**: Don't let the dice decide everything. Skill outweighs luck in _Miracuse_, ensuring that your sneaky assassin won't be tripping alarms just because of a bad roll.

* **Momentum**: Make the best of your sessions! Avoid long slogs through combat, shopping trips, and spell preparation. Gameplay built for action-packed adventuring.


### Comparisons

***D&D / Pathfinder***

_Miracuse_ is less tactical and mechanics-based than its older cousins. The lower complexity of the system can be a turn-off for players with a particular interest in optimization and war gaming. They may enjoy the new challenge found in creating unusually effective Kit combinations or unconventional builds.

Other categories of players, such as those who express a preference for roleplaying, will likely find this ruleset refreshing. Social abilities have been allocated to all four classes, removing the need for a "Face" character and allowing all party members to effectively participate in non-combat challenges. 


***FATE***

_Miracuse_ is a little more mechanically-driven than FATE but retains a similar philosophy towards gameplay. While you won't be working with Aspects and Stunts, you will have similar Skill and Health systems. GM's will find that the Gold and Silver rules of FATE undergird this system as well.

My experiences with running and playing in FATE is that there is some level of cognitive load associated with the open-ended creativity of the system. It's hard to continuously come up with new and dramatic things throughout the entire session. This system provides a little more structure with the intention of alleviating some mental overhead without locking players into a subset of allowed actions.

***Dungeon World***

_Miracuse_ borrows from Dungeon World's concepts. The simplified character creation system and purposefully limited character ability set (Kits) were both inspired by Dungeon World. However, playbooks and similar concepts were left by the wayside in favor of freeform gameplay.


### What kind of games is Miracuse intended to run?

_Miracuse_ is intended for use as a streamlined dungeon crawler with an emphasis on creativity, competency, and simple mechanics.

Players should be able to create a character quickly and easily. At a glance, it's apparent what a character is good at (skills) and what special abilities they have (kits). Options for customization are also readily available.

Gameplay is likewise designed to be intuitive. There are no complex calculations involved to determine whether or not an attack hits or how much damage is dealt. Magic and abilities are open-ended, with wording that encourages exploration rather than prescribing specific outcomes. 

And, most importantly, the narrative of a session is driven predominately by the intentions of the players. The impact of luck on any given action is less than the impact of character skill. Strong characters will usually succeed in being strong, magic characters will usually succeed in doing magic, and so on.
