# Design Decisions

**_Competency_**: Adventurers are good at what they're good at. The majority of rolls should reflect their ability, not their luck.

    The dice system has hard boundaries [-2, +2].

    Higher Skill levels eliminate the possibility of Catastrophic Failure.

**_Niche Specialization_**: Different adventurers are good at different things. No adventurer should be able to do everything.

    Each base class has different Skills and Kits.

    Emulating features of a different class comes at a cost (Kits, Skill points, etc.).

**_Universal Participation_**: Every player should be able to participate in the "three pillars" (social, exploration, combat) regardless of class. Players should not feel the need to sit out scenes for mechanical reasons.

    Each base class has a Social Skill and an Attack Skill.

    Each base class has unique Skills or Kits that can open up new options while exploring.

**_FATE's Golden and Silver Rules_**:

    "Figure out what you want to do first, then see how the rules help you accomplish it."

    "Never let the rules get in the way of what makes narrative sense."

**_Varying Engagement Levels_**: Players that love mastering mechanics and players that hate mastering mechanics should both be able to enjoy the game. Offer systems that appeal to both types of players.

    Players can choose one of the existing classes or create a custom class.

    Kits can be changed as frequently or infrequently as a Player wants.

**_Reasonable Expectations of Players_**: Keep player experience in mind, and only ask of them as much as they're comfortable with.

    Characters only have four Kits at any one time (reduce memorization required).

    Inventory management is not a component of this system.

    All actions use the same 1d10 die + Skill level roll.

    Character backgrounds are optional.

**_Minimize Solo Play_**: Activities that regularly split the party should be identified and replaced with suitable mechanics.

    Scouting has a specific mechanic to avoid lengthy solo stealth missions.

    Shopping, which can take quite a bit of real world time in some TTRPG's, is not a component of this system.

    Subclasses have 6 Kits each with concise descriptions, so as to mitigate player decision paralysis when changing Kits, and to reduce the amount of memorization required of GM's.

### Design Inspirations

**FATE**, for its Skill-oriented resolution mechanics and design philosophy.

**D&D**, for its concept and settings.

**Dungeon World**, for its fail-forward system, no GM dice approach, and fast character creation.

**The AngryGM**, for his thoughts on how combat and boss fights ought to work.

**Pathfinder** and **Shadowrun**, for helping me understand my own opinions on complexity.

**Blades in the Dark**, for the idea of Loadout that I've been happily misinterpreting ever since.
