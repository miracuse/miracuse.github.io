### Factions

**_The Nations_**

A collection of long-lived dynasties. Ruled by kings, czars, and other autocrats, the Nations are a manifestation of old world power. Their ancestral orders have ruled for centuries by maintaining a monopoly on natural resources, military power, and local mages. The advent of Guilds has their influence on the wane, a source of significant animosity.

**_The Guilds_**

Various international professional organizations. The largest among them is the Alchemist Guild, a relative newcomer that has asserted full control over the production of potions and firearms. Others members include merchant guilds, courier guilds (like the Bards), and mercenary guilds.

**_The Knight Orders_**

Ancient and honorable coalitions. The ranks of Knight Orders are filled with talented warriors and devoted priests. They serve humanity as stalwart defenders of the innocent and as medics who treat wounds on both sides of a battlefield. Though noble in intention, Knight Orders tend to have very traditional views on right and wrong.

**_The Tribes_**

Nomadic peoples from outside the Nations. The less educated see them as a singular barbarian horde, but learned scholars have identified dozens of independent groups bound together by family ties. People of the Tribes tend to be hardy, eking out a living through hunting and goat herding. It's not uncommon for members to serve as sellswords in exchange for alchemical and agricultural products.

**_The Temples_**

Diverse and varied institutions with a relationship to otherworldly spirits. Temple is a broad term that encompasses any permanent collection of Mages. Some serve a traditional religious role, advocating on behalf of their patron spirits. Others train Mages to serve their Nation in times of conflict. Still others are contemplative retreats where those in need can rest and find peace.
