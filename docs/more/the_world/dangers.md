# Dangers

### Monsters

Wildlife that poses a threat to the inhabitants of the land. The world is home to many dangerous creatures that still offer a formidable challenge to peacekeeping forces. The Knight Orders, Mercenary Guilds, and various Nation militaries send out parties to deal with particularly dangerous creatures that have decided to prey on humans.

##### Examples

* Worgs
* Manticores
* Sky Raptors
* Ancient Swamp Alligators
* Leviathans
* Dragons

### Black Magic

Mages draw their power from forces beyond this world, forces which are not always benign or indifferent to humanity. Some actively seek to cause strife by corrupting the living, undermining natural order, and distorting minds. They look to secure footholds in the mortal world through cults and temptations.

##### Examples

* Skeletons
* Zombies
* Demons
* Renegade [Conjurers](../specializations/conjurer.html)
* The Fey
* Evil Jinn

### Politics

The various factions of the known world hold an uneasy peace for the moment, but they each have their own ambitions and internal problems. The Nations have a long history of waging war on one another over land, and have only recently decided on an informal truce to avoid showing weakness in front of The Guilds.

The Guilds, for their part, are filled with newly wealthy tradesman and merchants. Whether or not they're able to retain their newfound power (and use it wisely) remains to be seen.

##### Examples

* Bandits
* Mercenaries
* [Assassins](../specializations/assassin.html)
* [Battlemages](../specializations/shaman.html)
* [Sharpshooters](../specializations/sapper.html)
* [Mage Hunters](../specializations/templar.html)
* [Sky Pirates](../specializations/corsair.html)
