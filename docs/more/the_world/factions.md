# Factions

### The Nations

A collection of long-lived dynasties. Ruled by kings, czars, and other autocrats, the Nations are a manifestation of old world power. Their ancestral orders have ruled for centuries by maintaining a monopoly on natural resources, military power, and local mages. The advent of Guilds has their influence on the wane, a source of significant animosity.

> [Legionnaires](specializations/legionnaire.html) form the backbone of many nations, both as military forces and as landed nobility. In nations where magic is a requisite for political standing, [Priests](specializations/priest.html) and [Shamans](specializations/shaman.html) hold positions as civil officials. A few eccentric [Wizards](specializations/wizard.html) are known to make their homes in the Nations, though they rarely involve themselves in politics.

### The Guilds

Various international professional organizations. The largest among them is the Alchemist Guild, a relative newcomer that has asserted full control over the production of potions and firearms. Others members include merchant guilds, courier guilds (like the Bards), and mercenary guilds.

> [Chemists](specializations/chemist.html), [Enchanters](specializations/enchanter.html), [Sappers](specializations/sapper.html), and other Alchemists are trained and staffed by the Alchemist Guild. Similarly, [Bards](specializations/bard.html) learn their trade within the Courier Guild. [Assassins](specializations/assassin.html) have no official guild, but find regular employment among the others.

### The Knight Orders

Ancient and honorable coalitions. The ranks of Knight Orders are filled with talented warriors and devoted priests. They serve humanity as stalwart defenders of the innocent and as medics who treat wounds on both sides of a battlefield. Though noble in intention, Knight Orders tend to have very traditional views on right and wrong.

> Unsurprisingly, [Knights](../more/specializations/knight.md) are prevalent in the Orders. [Priests](specializations/priest.html), [Templars](specializations/templar.html), and the occasional [Spellsword](specializations/spellsword.md) are also common. [Fell Knights](specializations/fell_knight.html) are affiliated, though several Orders condemn their existence.

### The Tribes

Nomadic peoples from outside the Nations. The less educated see them as a singular barbarian horde, but learned scholars have identified dozens of independent groups bound together by family ties. People of the Tribes tend to be hardy, eking out a living through hunting and goat herding. It's not uncommon for members to serve as sellswords in exchange for alchemical and agricultural products.

> Warriors trained in the tradition of the Tribes are commonly [Rangers](specializations/ranger.html), though a few [Blademasters](specializations/blademaster.md) are in residence. [Shamans](specializations/shaman.html) and [Druids](specializations/druid.html) make up the backbone of magic practitioners. A fair number of youths pick up the [Corsair](specializations/corsair.html) or [Gunslinger](specializations/gunslinger.html) trades while serving on sea and sky fleets.

### The Temples

Diverse and varied institutions with a relationship to otherworldly spirits. Temple is a broad term that encompasses any permanent collection of Mages. Some serve a traditional religious role, advocating on behalf of their patron spirits. Others train Mages to serve their Nation in times of conflict. Still others are contemplative retreats where those in need can rest and find peace.

> Mages of any stripe can be found at the Temples, with the notable exception of [Conjurers](specializations/conjurer.html), who are unwelcome in nearly any land.

### The Lost Empire

A sprawling country that once ruled over the known world. Many of the The Nations were former principalities, and several claim to be its true successor. The Lost Empire's fall took place centuries ago, and no one is quite certain what caused it.

> [Antiquarians](specializations/antiquarian.html) are scholars that study the Lost Empire and use its "Sigils", geometric designs of power that once held together the Empire's infrastructure.
