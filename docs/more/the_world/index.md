# The World

> **Note**: _Miracuse_ can be used with repurposed for use in many swords-and-sorcery worlds. A setting is provided, but GM's are welcome to build their own.

The world of _Miracuse_ is one on the edge of revolution.

Feudal monarchies have ruled most of the known world since the fall of [The Lost Empire](factions.html#the-lost-empire). For centuries, the machinations of kings and priests have been a central fixture of daily life. But the balance of power has begun to crumble with the advent of alchemy.

Newly formed [Guilds](factions.html#the-guilds) have accumulated vast fortunes through the distribution of non-magical medicines and firearms, enough to rival [The Nations](factions.html#the-nations) through sheer economic force. Guild mercenaries have found success in matching the previously unrivaled supremacy of national militaries. And Guild spies, independent of royal whims, have established the greatest information network ever seen.

However, the nobility of the old world have no intention of letting upstarts take their rightful place in the world. The Guilds may be a rising star, but the people of [The Nations](factions.html#the-nations) still rely upon their social betters to protect them from monsters, black magic, and banditry. Mercenaries are a poor substitute for [Knight Orders](factions.html#the-knight-orders).

Rising tensions have left many uneasy. In a land plagued by so many dangers, in-fighting between [The Nations](factions.html#the-nations) and The Guilds could result in an opening for any number of opportunistic attackers. [The Tribes](factions.html#the-tribes) rank chief among the possible threats as historical boogeymen. They hold a long tradition of sacking exposed cities and extorting tribute.

### Adventurers

**Adventurers** are a varied bunch. They might be journeyman, knight errants, bounty hunters, escaped slaves, missionaries, or simple mercenaries. They take odd jobs that others can't or won't.

- A Knight Order that has its hands full might conscript a band of adventurers to investigate rumors of dark magic.

- A queen might commission adventurers to subjugate dangerous monsters plaguing a frontier town.

- A Guild might request an escort for one of their airships, or ask for assistance sabotaging a competitor.
