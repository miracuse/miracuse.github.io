# Alchemy Revisited

{% include ability_table.html %}

Alchemy has a unique position in Miracuse. Unlike Magic and Techniques, each Kit has its own resource pool. This allows Alchemists to perform a great many "big" effects before depleting themselves.

The downside to Alchemy is that its Kits generally do not have passive effects. A Mage never runs out of Cantrips. A Soldier can always add a Technique to an attack. But an Alchemist that's spent all of their Kits has to rely solely on their Skills.

### Items vs. Spells

Items and Spells have similar levels of power. A _Thermal Charge_ grenade is very similar to a Mage casting a fireball spell.

Alchemists can create that specific effect several times before running out of resources. They also don't need to burn their own health to do so.

However, Mages have more flexibility in the effects they can produce. A Mage with the _Spirit of Fire_ and _Spirit of Air_ might cast a fireball. Or they might create a small flaming tornado, stop a forest fire, make a gust of superheated air, etc. Mages have more options when spending their resources, but can do so fewer times between rests.

### Items FAQ

-   **Can I hand out Alchemy Items to other Player Characters?**

Yes. As mentioned under the [Alchemist] class page, all Alchemy Items besides potions require a Knowledge check for safe-handling. That means that grenades, substances, tools, and other Items can be used by others but may cause disastrous results in untrained hands.

-   **Does drinking a potion take an action in combat?**

Yes. Narratively, you might imagine that drinking something like an _Elixir_ would mend bones back together. This would be a fairly traumatic experience, and would preclude trying to do something else in the same time frame.

-   **Can I combine Alchemy Items like Spells or Techniques?**

Usually no. A GM might allow you to roll Knowledge to combine Items if you have a specific outcome in mind, but doing so isn't a core part of Alchemy the way it is for the other two subsystems.
