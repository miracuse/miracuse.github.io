# Alchemy Revisited

{% include ability_table.html %}

### Charges

Unlike Spirit and Technique Kits, each Alchemy Kit has its own resource pool. This allows Alchemists to perform many "big" effects before depleting themselves. While the other classes might manage four Spells or amplified Techniques before needing to rest, the Alchemist has sixteen Charges.

The downside to Alchemy is that its Kits can only be used for "big" effects. A Mage never runs out of Cantrips. A Soldier or Scoundrel can always add a Technique to an attack without paying a cost. But an Alchemist can only use their Kits by spending a Charge. Once they're out of Charges, their Kits are effectively useless.

### Items vs. Spells

Items and Spells have similar levels of power. A _Thermal Charge_ grenade is very similar to a Mage casting a fireball Spell.

However, Mages have more flexibility in the effects they can produce. A Mage with the _Spirit of Fire_ and _Spirit of Air_ might cast a fireball. Or they might create a small flaming tornado, stop a forest fire, make a gust of superheated air, etc. Mages have more options when spending their resources, but can do so fewer times between rests.

### Items FAQ

-   **Can I hand out Alchemy Items to other Player Characters?**

Yes. As mentioned under the [Alchemist](../../classes/alchemist/index.md) class page, all Alchemy Items besides potions require a Knowledge check for safe-handling. That means that grenades, substances, tools, and other Items can be used by others but may cause disastrous results in untrained hands.

-   **Does drinking a potion take an action in combat?**

Yes. Narratively, you might imagine that drinking something like an _Elixir_ would mend bones back together. This would be a fairly traumatic experience, and would preclude trying to do something else in the same time frame.

-   **Can I combine Alchemy Items like Spells or Techniques?**

Usually no. A GM might allow you to roll Knowledge to combine Items if you have a specific outcome in mind, but doing so isn't a core part of Alchemy the way it is for the other two subsystems.

-   **Can I have multiple golems/familiars/shikigamis/bags at one time?**

Yes.

-   **Can I use multiple runes on one object?**

Usually no, but this is ultimately the GM's decision.
