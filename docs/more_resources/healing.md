# Healing

Although [Making Camp](../adventuring/exploration/index.md) is the primary way to recover from damage and injuries, certain Kits can allow Players to use their Skills to restore health.

-   (Alchemist) _Elixir_

-   (Soldier) _Hospitaler_

-   (Mage) _Spirit of Restoration_

-   (Scoundrel) _Herbalism_

### Usage

When using these Kits, roll the associated Skill (such as Magic or Knowledge). The result determines either how many boxes of damage are cleared or whether or not a narrative outcome was achieved.

> **Note**: The Alchemist's _Elixir_ and the Scoundrel's _Herbalism_ are the only Kits capable of restoring Mental health.
