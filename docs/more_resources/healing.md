# Healing

    Player: I want to use an Elixir to clear out some of the
            Mage's Mental damage.

    GM:     Alright. Roll Knowledge.

    Player: That's a +1, for a total of +3.

    GM:     Okay. The Mage can clear three Mental Boxes.

Although [Making Camp](../adventuring/exploration/index.md) is the primary way to recover from damage and injuries, certain Kits allow Players to use their Skills.

-   (Alchemist) **Elixir**: Roll Knowledge. Can treat Physical or Mental damage.

-   (Soldier) **Hospitaler**: Roll Strength or Bravery. Can treat Physical damage.

-   (Mage) **Spirit of Restoration**: Roll Magic. Can treat Physical damage.

-   (Scoundrel) **Herbalism**: Roll Agility or Cunning. Can treat Physical or Mental damage.
