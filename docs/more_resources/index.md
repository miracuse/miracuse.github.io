<!-- >Note: This section contains optional information on gameplay.

Every group has their own preferred balance between improvisation and rules-based play. The **Miracuse** system provides a framework of rules, but tends to favor improvisation.

This design choice fosters creativity among Players and Game Masters. However, it also places a creative burden on everyone involved. The wonderful thing about rules is that they tell you "how" something is supposed to work. When no rule exists, it's up to the group to figure out how to adapt the existing rules. -->

This section provides additional resources and rules that groups can use.
