# Magic Revisited

### Overview

{% include ability_table.html %}

### Cantrips Revisited

**Cantrips** are minor miracles that Players can perform using the Magic Skill. They represent simple uses of Kits like _Spirit of Flame_.

The strength of cantrips is in their versatility. A Player can find any number of uses for, say, the ability to manipulate temperature (_Spirit of Thermos_) or sound (_Spirit of Sound_).

The weakness of cantrips is their low power level. "Minor miracle" puts the scale of possible effects in mind. A Player might throw lightning at an enemy, but they won't be able to call down a massive storm without upgrading from a cantrip to a spell.

### Cantrips as Attacks

Many cantrips can be used to inflict damage on enemies. Depending on how the _Spirit_ used, it may have an additional effect besides damage, similar to how [Techniques](../techniques/index.md) work. A couple examples:

* _Spirit of Sound_: Pierce an enemy's eardrums, dealing damage and rendering them deaf.

* _Spirit of Fire_: Throw fire at an enemy, dealing damage and setting anything flammable ablaze.

Other uses of cantrips may deal no damage, but produce a useful effect.

* _Spirit of Gravity_: Pin an enemy to the ground.

* _Spirit of Metal_: Trap an enemy's sword in its sheath, preventing them from drawing it.

* _Spirit of Warding_: Imprison an enemy in a barrier.


### Spells Revisited

**Spells** are more powerful magic effects that require two _Spirit_ Kits and cost the Player a Mental Health box to use.

Spells can help with nearly any possible adventuring challenge. They might bring terrible destruction in combat, scry the location of notorious criminal, charm the local populace into helping the party, or more.

The requirements to use spells keep them from being a silver bullet. First, a Player needs two _Spirit_ Kits equipped to cast a spell. Second, the cost is the user's Mental Health, which might also be targeted by enemies and hazards.

Savvy Mages will need to strike a careful balance between preserving their health and casting spells at pivotal moments. Reckless Players will quickly find themselves incapacitated by their risky playstyle.

### Spells as Attacks

Using spells to attack enemies is similar in power to using amplified or combined [Techniques](../techniques/index.md). A spell is liable to deal damage, produce additional effects, and may hit several targets instead of one. 

* _Blue Flame Lance_: (Fire + Thermos) Deals two boxes of Physical damage to anything in a straight line from the caster and sets all targets ablaze.

* _Power Word: Kneel_: (Sound + Language) Command all enemies in a large area to kneel. Those that resist take a box of Mental damage.

### Non-Mage Magic

The other three base classes have access to some _Spirit_ Kits.

While they are able to use those Kits with the Magic Skill, they'll generally get better results by paying the "price". This might be Fortune Points, Prep Points, or Charges depending on the Kit.

Paying the price allows these classes to cast a cantrip one time using a Skill other than Magic. If the Player has multiple _Spirit_ Kits equipped they can also cast a spell in the same fashion, though they will need to expend a Mental Health box just like a Mage would.
