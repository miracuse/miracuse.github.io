# Magic Revisited

### Overview

{% include ability_table.html %}

### Cantrips Revisited

**Cantrips** are minor miracles that Players can perform using the Magic Skill. They represent simple uses of Kits like _Spirit of Flame_.

The strength of cantrips is in their versatility. A Player can find any number of uses for, say, the ability to manipulate temperature (_Spirit of Thermos_) or sound (_Spirit of Sound_).

The weakness of cantrips is their low power level. "Minor miracle" puts the scale of possible effects in mind. A Player might throw lightning at an enemy, but they won't be able to call down a massive storm without upgrading from a cantrip to a spell.

### Spells Revisited

**Spells** are more powerful magic effects that require two _Spirit_ Kits and cost the Player a Mental Health box to use.

Spells can help with nearly any possible adventuring challenge. They might bring terrible destruction in combat, scry the location of notorious criminal, charm the local populace into helping the party, or more.

The requirements to use spells keep them from being a silver bullet. First, a Player needs two _Spirit_ Kits equipped to cast a spell. Second, the cost is the user's Mental Health, which might also be targeted by enemies and hazards.

Savvy Mages will need to strike a careful balance between preserving their health and casting spells at pivotal moments. Reckless Players will quickly find themselves incapacitated by their risky playstyle.

### Non-Mage Magic

The other three base classes have access to some _Spirit_ Kits.

While they are able to use those Kits with the Magic Skill, they'll generally get better results by paying the "price". This might be Fortune Points, Prep Points, or Charges depending on the Kit.

Paying the price allows these classes to cast a cantrip one time using a Skill other than Magic. If the Player has multiple _Spirit_ Kits equipped they can also cast a spell in the same fashion, though they will need to expend a Mental Health box just like a Mage would.
