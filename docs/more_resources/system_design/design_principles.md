# Design Principles

**_Discoverability_**: The system should be easy to learn for new and experienced players alike. Terminology is kept similar to other RPG games so as to encourage knowledge transfer.

**_Consistency_**: System mechanics are designed to be consistent, allowing players and GM's to intuit actions without having to reference the game manual. Subsystems are permitted but should be minimal.

**_Flexibility_**: Some mechanics, such as Kits, are given deliberately open-ended descriptions. Players are encouraged to explore the possibilities and combinations afforded.

**_Constraints_**: In contrast to the previous design principle, some elements have premade rulings that restrict player agency. This is done to reduce the group's cognitive load.
