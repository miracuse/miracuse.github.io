Originally intended as an assignment submission for a class on Human Centered Design (HCD), the Miracuse RPG system has since evolved into the author's pet project. Some of the principles discussed in [The Design of Everyday Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) were applied in the making of this game.
