# Techniques Revisited

### Overview

{% include ability_table.html %}

### Modify Attacks

Every Technique adds an additional effect to basic attacks. _Sunder_, for example, causes all successful attacks to deal an additional box of damage. _Smite_ staggers and knocks down enemies. _Cleave_ causes attacks to function in a small area-of-effect.

These effects have narrative implications as well. A character with _Sunder_ has no issue piercing armor or destroying metal obstacles with their weapons. Another with _Spellbreak_ might be able to parry fireballs and lightning bolts. As with other mechanics in _Miracuse_, Techniques follow FATE's [Silver Rule](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/what-do-during-play#the-silver-rule).

### Amplify Effects

Techniques can also be bolstered to near-superhuman levels by expending a Fortune or Prep Point. These effects operate on a similar power level to a Mage's Spells or an Alchemist's Items.

_Smite_ normally adds knockback to regular attacks. Amplifying _Smite_ might cause an enemy to go flying through the air, crashing into the ground dramatically with the wind knocked out of them. Or it might be used to knock over an enemy that would otherwise be resistant, like an elephant or a giant.

### Combining Effects

By default, **only one Technique can be activated on a regular attack**. Two Techniques can be used simultaneously if the Player pays a Fortune or Prep Points. In which case, the resulting effect will be on the same power level as an amplified Technique.

### Using Techniques without Kits

The effects that Techniques provide might plausibly be done without the corresponding Kit. A Player doesn't necessarily need the _Called Shot_ Kit to disarm an enemy or the _Sunder_ Kit to break armor. However, the action will be less effective in one or more of the following ways:

-   The action will create an effect but not deal damage.

-   The action will require a higher roll to succeed.

-   The action cannot be amplified or combined.


### Techniques FAQ

-   **Can I spend a Fortune Point to reroll an amplified or combined Technique?**

No. Only one Fortune Point can be expended per action.

-   **Can I use a Technique with a Sneak Attack?**

Yes.

-   **Can I use a Technique with a cantrip?**

Yes. If you have a character with both a Technique and magic, you can combine them provided that it makes narrative sense to do so. For example, you might throw a bolt of fire using _Spirit of Flame_ as an attack and augment it with _Smite_ to add a knockdown effect.

-   **Can I use a Technique with a spell?**

Usually no. Techniques tend to be spontaneous, while spells tend to be less so. You might be able to make an argument for narratively-justifiable situations with GM permission.

-   **Can I use a Technique with an Alchemist bullet?**

Yes.

-   **Can I use a Technique with an Alchemist grenade?**

Usually no, though as with anything, the narrative context is important.
