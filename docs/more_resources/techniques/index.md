# Techniques Revisited

### Overview

{% include ability_table.html %}

Techniques modify basic attacks with additional effects. Beyond that, they can also be amplified and combined to produce more potent results.

### Narrative Ruling

> "Never let the rules get in the way of what makes narrative sense." - FATE SRD

As with other mechanics in _Miracuse_, Techniques follow FATE's [Silver Rule](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/what-do-during-play#the-silver-rule). The effect of a Technique might be greater or lesser depending on the narrative context it's used in.

For example, _Harass_ won't have much effect on a zombie or a gelatinous cube, in the same way that throwing fire at a fire elemental won't deal damage. On the other hand, a Technique like _Smite_ may be especially impactful against small targets, sending them flying through the air instead of simply knocking them over.

### Using Techniques without Kits

The effects that Techniques provide might plausibly be done without the corresponding Kit. A Player doesn't necessarily need the _Called Shot_ Kit to disarm an enemy or the _Sunder_ Kit to break armor. However, the action will be less effective in one or more of the following ways:

-   The action will create an effect but not deal damage.

-   The action will require a higher roll to succeed.

-   The action cannot be amplified or combined.

### Non-Combat Applications

While Techniques are often used in the context of combat, they are fully applicable to other kinds of challenges. Players are encouraged to get creative in their problem-solving.

-   _Sunder_ can be used to destroy obstacles. A Player might cut through metal prison bars or obliterate a stone wall during an escape.

-   _Rally_, _Harass_, and _Impose_ provide Advantage when using Bravery to inspire, provoke, or intimidate respectively.

-   _Spellbreak_ can be used to break magical wards or threaten spirits that would normally only respond to a Mage.

### Techniques FAQ

-   **Can I use a Technique with a Sneak Attack?**

Yes.

-   **Can I use a Technique with a cantrip?**

Yes. If you have a character with both a Technique and magic, you can combine them provided that it makes narrative sense to do so. For example, you might throw a bolt of fire using _Spirit of Flame_ as an attack and augment it with _Smite_ to add a knockdown effect.

-   **Can I use a Technique with a spell?**

Usually no. Techniques tend to be spontaneous, while spells tend to be less so. You might be able to make an argument for narratively-justifiable situations with GM permission.

-   **Can I use a Technique with an Alchemist bullet?**

Yes.

-   **Can I use a Technique with an Alchemist grenade?**

Usually no, though as with anything, the narrative context is important.
