# Basics

As a GM, you have three basic [duties](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/running-game):

1. Keep the Game Moving

2. Build the World

3. Chairman of the Rules


### Keep the Game Moving

The key to a good game is managing momentum. Part of your responsibilities is deciding when to fast-forward to more exciting events.

A good way to think of this role is to consider modern TV shows or novels. Most of the content is focused on scenes where something happens; we don't generally spend time watching the characters buy their groceries or take bathroom breaks.

* **When players are uncertain what to do next, drop hints.**

If you find that your players can't decide how to move forward after a few minutes of discussion, consider taking action. Have them roll Perception to hear the sounds of marching in the distance, or tell them that there's smoke rising in the distance. Give them a sense of urgency by providing convenient plot hooks.

* **When fights are dragging on, introduce some chaos.**

Take action if you find that a fight has become dull and predictable. If the enemies are losing badly, break out of the skirmish and describe them running away or the players quickly mopping things up. If neither the party nor the enemies are giving any ground, introduce a complication. Have a third party stumble on the scene, or describe some impending threat like a river of lava slowly rising.


### Build the World

Running a game is one part preparation, one part improvisation. 

Remember that your role as the Game Master is to set the scene. Rather than dictating events, try to make a stage for the players to perform on then react to their decisions.

* **What happens if the players do nothing?**

A great leading question is to imagine how a scene plays out if the players never arrive. What consequences follow if the party ignores those reports of necromancers in the north? 

* **Beware Assumptions.**

Be careful not to assume that players will react in a specific way to the world you build. More often than not, they're liable to go off the rails. It's often better to react to a player's decision than to coerce them in a certain direction.


### Chairman of the Rules

The last of your duties is to interpret the rules of the game.

One of your players is going to ask you if they can make a fire sword with their fire magic. You're going to have to decide if they can. Will you make them roll for it? Is it even possible? Do they need certain Kits? The judgment call is yours.

* **You Are the Players Biggest Fan (AKA "The Rule of Cool")**

The major draw of a tabletop RPG over a video game is that the boundaries are much more flexible. There is room for interpretation in the rules between you and your players. If a player shows an interest in something, try to meet them halfway.

"No, you can't do XYZ, but maybe if you find ABC..."

* **Chairman, Not God.**

As eloquently laid out in the [Fate source rules](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/running-game#youre-the-chairman-not-god), you are the "First Among Equals". If there's a ruling you're uncertain about, ask the other players their thoughts. You have the final word but that doesn't mean that you need to be the sole authority.
