# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q**: When do I, as the GM, roll dice?

**A**: Very rarely. Miracuse is designed so that most rolls are done by the players against some level of opposition.

---

**Q**: What happens when a roll ties?

**A**: The rule of thumb is "Defender Wins". Defender might be literal, as someone defending against an attack, or might be more vague, like a character trying to hide from pursuers.

---

**Q**: How do I set difficulty levels?

**A**: Think about what makes narrative sense. Then consult the Skill Ladder. Is this something that a Proficient (+1) person could do? How about someone Trained (+2) for this sort of task? The [GM Helper Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NhqEjr0m4iug3n5NBa_rJ18LO9duhfDB2b4FYmKKZ4w/edit?usp=sharing) go into more detail on this.

**Q**: Is a character incapacitated when they run out of health boxes?

**A**: No. A character is incapacitated when they have to mark a damage box but have none available. They're still standing until then.

---

**Q**: Does a character die when they're incapacitated?

**A**: No. Usually they fall unconscious, or might be taken out differently depending on the cause of the attack (struck blind by magic, gibbering from mental trauma, etc.) Characters generally should not be killed off unless [cinematically appropriate](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/getting-taken-out#character-death).
