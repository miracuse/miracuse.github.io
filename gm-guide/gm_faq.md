# Frequently Asked Questions (GM Version)

**Q: When do I, as the GM, roll dice?**

**A**: Very rarely. Miracuse is designed so that most rolls are done by the players against some level of opposition.

One occasion when you do roll dice is when deciding a completely luck-based outcome.

**Q: How do I set difficulty levels?**

**A**: Think about what makes narrative sense. Then consult the Skill Ladder. Is this something that a Proficient (+1) person could do? How about someone Trained (+2) for this sort of task? The [GM Helper Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NhqEjr0m4iug3n5NBa_rJ18LO9duhfDB2b4FYmKKZ4w/edit?usp=sharing) go into more detail on this.

**Q: Why does the game system do XYZ this way and not that way?**

**A:** Wherever possible I've tried to have every decision in Miracuse refer back to a set of [Design Principles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KnDiDKgTnVuIRpurhtvs6v_3UMX38hl9A5p07Mbqdec/edit?usp=sharing). The various mechanics should, in theory, stem from decisions made to prioritize discoverability, consistency, flexibility, and constraints. 

However, you are the GM of your own game. If you feel that the game would be more enjoyable with some tweaks, I encourage you to do so!
