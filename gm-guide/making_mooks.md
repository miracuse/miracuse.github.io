# Making Mooks

Mooks are designed to be easily improvised. If you need to throw an enemy at the players, pick one of the existing stat blocks on the [GM Helper Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NhqEjr0m4iug3n5NBa_rJ18LO9duhfDB2b4FYmKKZ4w/edit?usp=sharing).

|             |                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Plain Mook  | Low stats, dangerous in groups                     |
| Hitters     | High offense, high damage, low health, low defense |
| Tanks       | High defense OR high health, low damage            |
| Mook Groups | Good all-around stats                              |
| Puzzles     | High stats, but at least one glaring weakness      |


### Mook Templates

Sometimes you want to spice up enemies with new abilities and behaviors. A helpful optional tool for accomplishing that is to add a Template to a mook.

>***Runaway Bomber***
>
>* Gain access to the *Firebomb* Alchemist Kit with one use
>
>* Gain access to the *Smash and Grab* Criminal Kit
>
>* In combat, throw the Firebomb (vs. Agility 1) and immediately retreat (vs. Agility 1)

A GM might apply this to a bandit, a goblin, or a wandering alchemist. The mook might be a part of a team whose strategy relies on baiting the players into a trap. Or they might be guerrilla fighters trying to wear down the party. In either case, Templates can add depth to combat encounters beyond basic stat blocks.

More templates can be found on the [GM Helper Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NhqEjr0m4iug3n5NBa_rJ18LO9duhfDB2b4FYmKKZ4w/edit?usp=sharing).


### Playing Mooks

One of the tenets of Miracuse is that the GM reacts to their players' decisions. Combat is no exception.

When a player attacks a mook, they will roll to beat the mook's defence. 

When a player defends against a mook attack, they will roll to beat the mook's offense. And when they fail, they will take a flat amount of damage.

The GM rarely rolls, instead narrating what happens and guiding the mooks' actions according to how they might reasonably behave. It's helpful then to have some idea of what your mooks' interests are. Or, as one writer put it:

>"Does that goblin think it can win? Is it willing to die trying? Does it have an opportunity to slip away? Will it cower and beg for its life?"
