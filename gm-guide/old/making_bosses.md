# Making Bosses

The procedure for making bosses is slightly more involved than for mooks, but the same concepts apply.

A boss will have multiple stat blocks, one for each of their Stages. After sustaining enough damage they will move from one stat block to the next.


### Example: Bandit Chief

Example bosses can be found in the [GM Helper Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wxh7dnNsPwu2GWNAlKc6xBhLHH4P1KA8cSo2YKU2nww/edit#gid=416188722).

A **Bandit Chief** is shown at the top with two stages. In the first stage, they have three Physical and three Mental health, as well as a template that lets them act two times in a round of combat.

When the **Bandit Chief** would be taken out, they instead move to the second stage stat block. Their health resets to three Physical and three Mental. Their defense drops, making them easier to hit. And they acquire another template "Wide Swings" that changes their attacks to area-of-effect.


### Difficulty Guidelines

Boss battles can be tricky to get right. You want to challenge the players but not curbstomp them. 

It can be beneficial to think of them in the same terms as dungeons. Create more Stages than you need, and you will be able to "cut" stages if the fight proves tougher than expected.

Alternatively, not every boss battle needs to end in death. Maybe the party is taken prisoner and sold to slave traders. Maybe the party makes a hasty retreat from an enemy outside their capabilities. Try to find a path forward that's enjoyable for those involved.


### Recommended Characteristics

* Boss enemies should usually have a high chance to hit.

* Boss enemies should act multiple times in a single round, or have minions on hand, to avoid players dogpiling them.

* Boss enemies should have multiple Stages, so that *when* the players throw all their strongest attacks, they don't take out the boss in one turn.

* Boss enemies (and mooks) should have distinctive behaviors. At what point does the boss try to run away from a losing battle? Do they have a trick up their sleeve when things are going poorly?
