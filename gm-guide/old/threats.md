# Threats

Threats are anything that endanger the players. They can be environmental **Hazards** like falling boulders, nameless **Mooks** like goblins, or more imposing **Bosses**. Examples of threats can be found in the [GM Helper Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NhqEjr0m4iug3n5NBa_rJ18LO9duhfDB2b4FYmKKZ4w/edit?usp=sharing).


### Hazards

[Hazards](https://fate-srd.com/fate-adversary-toolkit/obstacles) can represent anything from the discomfort of exploring inhospitable locations to intentional traps. Their one unifying characteristic is that **they can't be solved by punching.**

Some hazards are player-made (caltrops, smoke screens, etc.) Some can be disabled (traps). Others have to be endured or worked around (scorching desert).

You should feel free to ad-lib Hazards without too much regard for templates. See a tall cliffside? Climbing it takes an Agility roll of 1 or higher. There's a smokescreen in the air? Anyone in the smoke takes advantage when dodging attacks, but disadvantage on Perception. Create effects that make narrative sense.


### Mooks

[Mook](https://fate-srd.com/fate-adversary-toolkit/enemies) is a catch-all term for generic enemies. Unlike hazards, **they can be be solved by punching**. 


### Bosses

[Bosses](https://fate-srd.com/fate-adversary-toolkit/enemies) are the bigger, badder counterparts to Mooks. They're designed to put up a better fight.

One way that we can accomplish that is through Stages. When a boss runs out of health (Physical or Mental), you check a Stage box and remove all damage. Stages can also be used to unlock more dangerous abilities to keep fights lively and evolving.
