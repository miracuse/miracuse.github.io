# Health and Harm

While adventuring, characters are guaranteed to find themselves in harm's way. When this happens the GM will tell you to mark **Damage**. 

| Damage Track |         |         |
| ------------ | ------- | ------- |
| Physical     | &#9745; | &#9744; |
| Mental       | &#9744; | &#9744; |


### Incapacitation and Injury

If a character has to mark damage and has no empty boxes, they become incapacitated and take an injury.

* **Incapacitated** characters cannot act until their damage track is completely clear, either by resting at camp or by receiving treatment.

* **Injured** characters take a -1 penalty to relevant rolls until they rest at camp. The GM will describe what kind of injury your character receives.

| Injury Track |         | 
| ------------ | ------- | 
| Physical     | &#9745; | 
| Mental       | &#9744; | 


### Overflow Damage and Injuries

When incapacitated, any additional damage has no effect.

Likewise, characters can only have one Physical and one Mental injury at a time. Becoming incapacitated with an injury will not cause any additional effects.

<!-- | Ten-Sided Die | Physical         | Mental    |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| 1             | Damaged Foot     | Dazed     |
| 2             | Damaged Knee     | Migraine  |
| 3             | Damaged Groin    | Confused  |
| 4             | Damaged Back     | Exhausted |
| 5             | Damaged Ribs     | Manic     |
| 6             | Damaged Hand     | Shaken    |
| 7             | Damaged Shoulder | Stirred   |
| 8             | Damaged Neck     | Gibbering |
| 9             | Damaged Face     | Lifeless  |
| 10            | Damaged Eyes     | Wrathful  | -->

<!-- ### Recovery

Both damage and injuries are cleared after resting at camp overnight. Damage can also be recovered using certain Kits.

Some injuries may have additional requirements to remove. These represent special circumstances, such as being poisoned or cursed. The GM will offer advice on how to seek treatment. -->
