# Hybrid Classes

Players interested in creating their own class can mix together two existing classes using the following process:

* Choose two classes
* From each class, choose one Skill and one Kit type
* Set one of the Skills to +2, the other to +1
* Choose one additional Skill, set to +1
* Name the new class


### Example

| Wizard      |                                                   |                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Class       | **<span style="color:#953553">Mage</span>**       | **<span style="color:#268bd2">Alchemist</span>**      |
| Skill       | **<span style="color:#953553">Aura (+2)</span>**  | **<span style="color:#268bd2">Knowledge (+1)</span>** |
| Kit Type    | **<span style="color:#953553">Elemental</span>**  | **<span style="color:#268bd2">Drugs</span>**          |
| Bonus Skill | **<span style="color:#953553">Focus (+1)</span>** |                                                       |

### Differences Between Base and Hybrid Classes

| Base                                 | Hybrid                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Have one Attack and one Social Skill | Can have any combination of Skills |
| Have 18 to 24 Kits                   | Have 12 Kits                       |
| Have two Skills (+2, +2)             | Have three Skills (+2, +1, +1)     |

Hybrid classes lose some versatility by having fewer Kits. In exchange, they allow for combinations that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

Players are encouraged to experiment with hybrid classes if they have a particular character concept in mind, such as "a thief that uses bombs" or "a warrior that knows magic".
