# About

_Miracuse_ is a Tabletop Role Playing Game where you and your friends play as a group of adventurers in a fantasy world of swords and sorcery. You'll work together to explore ancient ruins, fight monsters, and solve mysteries.

### How to Play

One person will act as the **Game Master** (GM). They'll be responsible for playing the skeletons, merchants, and other people you meet in the game. The other members of your group are **Players**. Each player will have their own character that explores the world, facing challenges and helping to write the story of what happens.

### Getting Started

Players should create a character on the [Game Sheets](docs/game_sheets.html) page, looking over some of the basic rules.

The GM should review all of the content on this site and [prepare a short adventure](docs/gm_pages/first_session.md).
