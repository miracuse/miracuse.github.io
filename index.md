# The Game

Miracuse is a Tabletop RPG game where you and your friends play as a group of adventurers in a fantasy world of swords and sorcery. You'll work together to explore ancient ruins, fight monsters, and solve mysteries.

# How to Play

One person will act as the **Game Master** (GM). They'll be responsible for playing the skeletons, merchants, and other people you meet in the game.

The other members of your group are **Players**. Each player will have their own character that explores the world, facing challenges and helping to write the story of what happens.

# Why to Play

* You like novels about fantastical lands and the heroes who live in them
* You're a fan of other Tabletop RPG's like *Dungeons and Dragons* and *Fate*
* You want to try something new with your friends
