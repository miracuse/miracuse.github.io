# The Game

Miracuse is a Tabletop RPG game where you and your friends play as a group of adventurers in a fantasy world of swords and sorcery. You'll work together to explore ancient ruins, fight monsters, and solve mysteries.

# How to Play

One person will act as the **Game Master** (GM). They'll be responsible for playing the skeletons, merchants, and other people you meet in the game.

The other members of your group are **Players**. Each player will have their own character that explores the world, facing challenges and helping to write the story of what happens.

# Getting Started

The GM should make a copy of the [Interactive Game Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brFenR5vdGR1WZTATQ3dmPmJ4uAa26q3z9aLEx-tAqI/edit?usp=sharing) and share it with their players. 

Players should open the game sheets and follow the instructions within to make their character. The content on the site will help to explain how game is played.
