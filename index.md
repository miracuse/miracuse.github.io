# About

Miracuse is a Tabletop RPG game where you and your friends play as a group of adventurers in a fantasy world of swords and sorcery. You'll work together to explore ancient ruins, fight monsters, and solve mysteries.

### How to Play

One person will act as the **Game Master** (GM). They'll be responsible for playing the skeletons, merchants, and other people you meet in the game. The other members of your group are **Players**. Each player will have their own character that explores the world, facing challenges and helping to write the story of what happens.

### Getting Started

Players should pick a [Class](docs/classes/index.md) and fill out a [Character Sheet](docs/character_sheet.html).

The GM should review all of the content on this site and prepare a short adventure. Resources on the [GM Pages](docs/gm_pages/index.md) will help.
