# Kits and Class Mechanics

Each class (**<span style="color:#268bd2">Alchemist</span>**, **<span style="color:#d28445">Soldier</span>**, **<span style="color:#953553">Mage</span>**, and **<span style="color:#90a959">Scoundrel</span>**) has their own list of abilities, called Kits.

Players can choose up to four Kits at any given time and can change Kits in-game on a regular basis.

| Class     | Kit Type | Kit      | Description                          |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Alchemist | Tool     | Revolver | Make a Perception attack and add +1. |

A full list of Kits can be found on the [Interactive Game Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SPwXaMx6Yy55YtODYAHVMJWfV3SEqT7iQid76qavQCo/edit?usp=sharing).


### <span style="color:#268bd2">Alchemist</span>

Alchemist Kits have a limited number of uses based on the character's **<span style="color:#268bd2">Knowledge</span>**. Alchemists mark a box each time they use a Kit, and clear all boxes when resting at camp.

| Knowledge | Uses per Rest                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| 0         | &#9744; &#9744;                 |
| 1         | &#9744; &#9744; &#9744;         |
| 2         | &#9744; &#9744; &#9744; &#9744; |
| ...       | ...                             |


### <span style="color:#d28445">Soldier</span>

Soldiers have a number of **Fortune Points** equal to their **<span style="color:#d28445">Bravery</span>**. Fortune Points can be used to reroll any action the Soldier takes.

* Fortune Points can only be used once per roll
* Fortune Points recover after resting to a maximum of the Soldier's Bravery
* Several Soldier Kits offer ways to attain more Fortune Points


### <span style="color:#953553">Mage</span>

Mages can combine their Kits to produce stronger and more complex effects.

The player chooses two spirits, describes an effect they want to achieve, and rolls **<span style="color:#953553">Aura</span>** to see how well it goes. Using Kits in this fashion is called spellcasting, and requires the caster to mark one Mental Health box.

| Spell           | Description                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fireball        | Spirit of Fire + Air; an area-of-effect Physical attack that sets the surroundings on fire.           |
| Paralyzing Fear | Spirit of Fear + Binding; an area-of-effect Mental attack that prevents enemies from moving.          |
| Stone Wall      | Spirit of Earth + Warding; creates a wall of rock to serve as a barricade.                            |
| Muted Blur      | Spirit of Darkness + Silence: an area-of-effect gives Advantage on Cunning rolls for going unnoticed. |


### <span style="color:#90a959">Scoundrel</span>

Scoundrels rarely attract notice unless they want to. By default, anyone not actively searching an area must have a higher **<span style="color:#268bd2">Perception</span>** than the Scoundrel's **<span style="color:#90a959">Cunning</span>** to detect them. No rolls required. 

Besides going unnoticed, being in stealth provides several benefits:

* Attacks from stealth do not require rolls, and count as an automatic 10
* Enemies will not target the Scoundrel in combat
