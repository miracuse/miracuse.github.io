# Getting Started

The first thing to do is make a character. The [Interactive Game Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cY4KWxl4hnFNa8pxADSHeHmIqlgBL4068uAnY5wtHQg/edit?usp=sharing) provide a guided walkthrough.

* **Name:** What are you called?
* **Class:** Are you an **<span style="color:#268bd2">Alchemist</span>**, **<span style="color:#d28445">Soldier</span>**, **<span style="color:#953553">Mage</span>**, **<span style="color:#90a959">Scoundrel</span>**, or [something else](hybrid_classes.md)?

### Kits

Each Class has a list of Kits, abilities specific to their class. Players can choose up to four Kits at any given time and can change Kits in-game whenever characters make camp.

| Kit Type   | Kit            | Description                             |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Discipline | Xanatos Gambit | Rolling a 1 gives a +0 instead of a -2. |

A full list of Kits can be found on the [Interactive Game Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cY4KWxl4hnFNa8pxADSHeHmIqlgBL4068uAnY5wtHQg/edit?usp=sharing).

### Other Details

While not necessary to play, you may want to think about how to describe your character.

* What do they look like?
* What kind of clothes or armor do they wear?
* What kind of a personality do they have?
