# What You Do

The majority of actions you take will use one of the eight Skills in the game. 

| Skill                                             | Description                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **<span style="color:#268bd2">Perception</span>** | Awareness, lie detection, and investigation.            |
| **<span style="color:#268bd2">Knowledge</span>**  | General know-how, connections, and debate.              |
| **<span style="color:#d28445">Bravery</span>**    | Willpower, intimidation, and courage.                   |
| **<span style="color:#d28445">Physique</span>**   | Strength, martial arts, and physical health.            |

| **<span style="color:#953553">Focus</span>**      | Concentration, sixth sense, and mental health.          |
| **<span style="color:#90a959">Cunning</span>**    | Sneaking, sleight-of-hand, and bluffing.                |

Each class is Experienced (+2) in two Skills and Untrained (+0) in all others.

| Skill Level | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| -1          | Incompetent |
| +0          | Untrained   |
| +1          | Proficient  |
| +2          | Experienced |
| +3          | Specialist  |
| +4          | Expert      |

When taking an action, you add your Skill level to the results of a dice roll.

| Result | Roll       |
| ------ | ---------- |
| -2     | 1          |
| -1     | 2, 3       |
| +0     | 4, 5, 6, 7 |
| +1     | 8, 9       |
| +2     | 10         |


`Outcome = Roll + Skill`

### Examples

When you want to do something as your character, tell the GM.

>I want to swing my sword at the golem.
>
>I want to climb the cliffside.
>
>I want to talk to the door guard.

The GM will tell you what to do next, or what happens next if the task isn't too difficult.

>"Okay. Roll Physique."
>
>"Okay. Roll Agility."
>
>"Okay. You walk over and find the door guard dozing off."

The outcome of many actions depends on your Skills and your luck. 

>I have a +2 in Physique and rolled a +1. That's a total of +3.
>
>I have a 0 in Agility and rolled a -1. That's a total of -1.

The GM will interpret your results and tell you what happens next.

>"You got a +3? Alright, you gouge out a large chunk of rock with your sword."
>
>"You got a -1? That's not good. You try to climb, but wind up falling partway up. Mark a point of damage."


<!-- Depending on the outcome and the difficulty of the task, the GM will declare that one of the following has happened:

* **Critical Success** 
* **Success** 
* **Success at a Cost** 
* **Failure** 
* **Catastrophic Failure** 

*Success at a Cost* and *Catastrophic Failure* may require a roll on the table below.
