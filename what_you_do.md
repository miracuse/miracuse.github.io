### Rolling for Actions

Taking an action consists of rolling a ten-sided dice and adding a character's Skill level to the result.

`Outcome = Roll + Skill`

Higher rolls and higher Skill levels will improve the chance that an action succeeds.

| Result | Roll       | 
| ------ | ---------- | 
| -2     | 1          | 
| -1     | 2, 3       | 
| +0     | 4, 5, 6, 7 | 
| +1     | 8, 9       | 
| +2     | 10         | 


### Examples

When you want to do something as your character, tell the GM.

>I want to swing my sword at the golem.
>
>I want to climb the cliffside.
>
>I want to talk to the door guard.


The GM will tell you what to do next, or what happens next if the task isn't too difficult.


>"Okay. Roll Physique."
>
>"Okay. Roll Agility."
>
>"Okay. You walk over and find the door guard dozing off."


The outcome of many actions depends on your Skills and your luck.


>I have a +2 in Physique and rolled a +1. That's a total of +3.
>
>I have a 0 in Agility and rolled a -1. That's a total of -1.


The GM will interpret your results and tell you what happens next.


>"You got a +3? Alright, you gouge out a large chunk of rock with your sword."
>
>"You got a -1? That's not good. You get to the top, but it took a lot out of you. Mark a point of Physical damage."


<!-- Depending on the outcome and the difficulty of the task, the GM will declare that one of the following has happened:

* **Critical Success** 
* **Success** 
* **Success at a Cost** 
* **Failure** 
* **Catastrophic Failure** 

*Success at a Cost* and *Catastrophic Failure* may require a roll on the table below.
